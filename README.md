# Gender Diary

enGender keeps a person's gender transition in one place, on their own
device: moods, gender feelings on configurable scales, quick tags, notes,
photos, milestones. Web PWA + Android (Capacitor) from one SvelteKit
codebase. No accounts, no analytics, GPLv3. The hosted web app still uses
network requests to its own origin for the app shell and updates. Full
product spec in [prd.md](prd.md).

## Status

The **close-to-final frontend** is built and interactive: all 20 screens from
the PRD's screen list, 8 queer-flag palettes × light/dark, English + Polish,
walkable end to end on demo data. Design decisions and their history live in
[mockup/DESIGN.md](mockup/DESIGN.md) (the earlier static mockup in `mockup/`
is superseded by this app but kept for reference).

Not yet wired (Phase 1): SQLite persistence (SQLocal/OPFS + Capacitor
driver — the demo store behind `src/lib/data/` implements the same repository
interfaces), real photo storage, crypto for export/import, Capacitor shell,
notifications, real Rive assets (animated CSS stand-ins render in every Rive
slot and remain as fallbacks).

The app installs as a PWA and starts without a network. `src/service-worker.ts`
precaches the whole release into one cache per build version: app code,
SQLocal's worker and WASM, the bundled fonts and everything in `static/`. A new
release waits instead of taking over: `src/lib/pwa/update.ts` asks it to stop
waiting only once nothing is running that an activation must not land on, and
`src/lib/data/journal-busy.ts` is what answers that question. See
[ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-the-offline-shell-is-one-document-and-one-cache-per-release.md).
`npm run dev` does not register it, since a precached shell would be served
ahead of every edit; `npm run verify:build` installs it, kills the network and
starts the app again.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server with the demo control bar
npm run build      # static SPA bundle in build/ (adapter-static, no SSR)
npm run preview
npm run check      # svelte-check
npm run test:walkthrough  # the 15 walkable flows, in a real Chromium
npm run verify:hosting     # nginx-hosted origin checks + cold offline restart
npm run check:copy      # catalogue parity, and no new hardcoded copy
npm run check:licences  # every installed package's licence
node scripts/app-version.mjs   # what this checkout would build as
```

## Android

The Android app is the same static bundle in a Capacitor shell, with one
native piece: a local plugin that opens the journal over SQLCipher, because
the key model everything else assumes wants a raw key and no derivation of
its own (ADR-0020).

```
npm run build && npx cap sync android   # copy the web bundle into the APK
npm run test:android                    # the checks that need a real device
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

`cap sync` is not optional after a fresh clone: Capacitor generates
`android/capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/` and the copied web assets, and
neither is committed, so Gradle has nothing to build without it.

Building needs a **JDK 21** (Capacitor 8 compiles at that language level) and
an Android SDK at `$ANDROID_HOME`. `test:android` finds a JDK 21 itself if
sdkman has one, and says so plainly if it cannot.

`test:android` runs on two emulators, `gd26` (API 26, the spec's floor) and
`tracker35` (current Android), which it expects to exist; override with
`ANDROID_TIER_AVDS`. It starts them windowed because this machine's emulator
segfaults under `-no-window`; `ANDROID_TIER_HEADLESS=1` turns that off.

Android updates its WebView separately from the OS, so the API level does not
say what the app runs in. `capacitor.config.ts` puts the floor at Chrome 87 -
what Vite compiles the bundle to - and points `server.errorPath` at
`static/webview-too-old.html`, so a device below it gets a page saying which
component to update rather than a blank screen. `minWebViewVersion` alone does
not do that: without an error path Capacitor logs the failure and loads the
app anyway. See [ADR-0023](docs/adr/0023-the-android-floor-is-a-webview-version-not-an-api-level.md).

The API 26 emulator image ships Chrome 69 from 2018 and so cannot start the
app at all. It is where the error page is checked; the native half of the
suite runs there too, and the full suite runs on the current Android.

The version the build stamps into the app comes from a signed `v<semver>` tag
and from nowhere else, so ordinary builds are `0.0.0-dev` plus the commit
(ADR-0022). `GENDER_DIARY_VERSION` overrides it, which is how the release
pipeline hands one value to the bundle, the release notes and the Android
artifacts at once.

`check:copy` compares the two catalogues key by key and counts user-facing text
written straight into the markup. Hundreds of those literals are still there
from phase 0 and phase 1, so the check is a ratchet against
`messages/untranslated-literals.txt`: a count may not go up, and one that goes
down is recorded with `node scripts/check-copy.mjs --update`. A key the code
calls and no catalogue has is a type error already, so `npm run check` covers
that half.

`test:walkthrough` builds first (with the demo bar compiled in, since one
flow drives its jump-to-screen control) and serves that build, the same way
`verify:build` does - the dev server's dependency re-optimization forces a
mid-boot page reload that a static build doesn't have. It shares Chromium
launch and CHROMIUM_PATH override with `test:browser` and `verify:build`
via `tests/browser-harness.mjs`.

The dev/demo build shows a **demo bar** (theme toggle, phone-frame emulation,
reset demo state, jump-to-screen). It is compiled out of production builds
unless `VITE_DEMO=1`. The phone/desktop switch works by constraining the
app's container — the layout responds via container queries, the same
mechanism a resized browser window uses.

Demo state persists in `localStorage`; "Reset demo state" restores the Alice
persona. "Onboarding (first run)" in the jump list clears it and walks the
true first-launch flow. The demo import password is `demo` (any other input
shows the wrong-password state).

## CI and releases

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pull requests and on `main`, since tickets
here merge locally and main is where work actually lands. It installs from the
lockfile and then splits: one job builds, type-checks, runs the Node tier and
the copy and licence checks; the other drives a real Chromium through the
browser tier, the walkthroughs and `verify:build`; and the Android job builds an
unsigned debug APK, checks the Android runtime graph against the no-Firebase/no-
analytics policy, and records an F-Droid rebuild attempt report. A failed
browser run keeps its output as an artifact for a week - every fixture in it is
synthetic, and no job in that workflow is given a secret.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on a `v*` tag. It reads the version once,
through `scripts/app-version.mjs`, so an unsigned tag or a tag on an edited tree
produces no release at all (ADR-0022); hands that string to everything else
through `GENDER_DIARY_VERSION`; takes the notes out of `CHANGELOG.md`; and
publishes a web bundle, a source archive, signed Android artifacts and
checksums. The App Bundle upload to Play internal runs in that same protected
environment.

Cut release tags through the script below instead of creating GitHub releases
manually. It enforces a clean `main`, requires a workflow-triggering
`v<semver>` tag, checks that `CHANGELOG.md` has notes for that version, creates
an annotated signed tag, and pushes it so the release workflow can publish the
signed APK Obtainium expects.

```
npm run release:tag -- 1.2.3-alpha.1 --dry-run
npm run release:tag -- 1.2.3-alpha.1
```

```
node scripts/release-notes.mjs [version]   # what the release would say
node scripts/package-release.mjs           # bundle, source archive, checksums
```

Both refuse a development version, so a dry run of the whole path means handing
one over deliberately: `GENDER_DIARY_VERSION=1.2.3 node scripts/package-release.mjs`.
Packaging builds twice and stops unless both bundles have the same digest,
because a checksum over a bundle nobody can rebuild only says the download
arrived intact. Anyone else can repeat that from the published source archive,
which has no tags to read, so the version has to be handed over:

```
tar xzf gender-diary-src-1.2.3.tar.gz && cd gender-diary-1.2.3
npm ci && GENDER_DIARY_VERSION=1.2.3 npm run build
tar --create --sort=name --owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner --mtime=@0 \
    --format=gnu --directory=build . | gzip --no-name --best | sha256sum
```
 Every release section in `CHANGELOG.md` has to answer four
questions - schema changes, Archive format changes, security migrations,
minimum supported version - and the pipeline stops before it builds anything if
one of them is blank. Everything left in `dist/release/` is checksummed and
attached. The signed APK there is always named
`gender-diary-android-release-<version>.apk`, so it cannot be confused with
debug or unsigned artifacts.

F-Droid rebuilds from public source and signs with F-Droid's own key. That key
is not update-compatible with this repository's signed APK, so moving between
those channels is a reinstall plus Archive restore rather than an in-place
update.

Progressive release exercises are recorded and validated with ticket 22's gate:

```
npm run check:progressive-release -- --file docs/progressive-release-record.json --target stage1
npm run check:progressive-release -- --file docs/progressive-release-record.json --target stage2
npm run check:progressive-release -- --file docs/progressive-release-record.json --target stage3
npm run check:progressive-release -- --file docs/progressive-release-record.json --target stage4
npm run check:progressive-release -- --file docs/progressive-release-record.json --target stable
```

See `docs/progressive-release.md` and start from
`scripts/progressive-release-record.template.json`.

The DNS record, deployment access, store account and signing key behind all of
this are steps a person has to take, on one particular machine, so the wizard
that walks them is untracked operator tooling rather than part of the app.
What it produces is not:
[docs/provisioning.md](docs/provisioning.md) names every secret and variable the
pipeline expects, where each one lives, and which ticket reads it.

Hosting and release-switch mechanics are tracked in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md),
including the nginx snippets, atomic switch command and schema-guarded rollback.

## Stack

SvelteKit + Svelte 5 (runes) + TypeScript, `adapter-static` SPA. Melt UI
builders where they exist today (slider, toggle); sheets are a small custom
dialog until Melt's Svelte 5 dialog lands. Paraglide for i18n (en/pl,
`messages/`). Hand-rolled SVG charts on `d3-scale` + `d3-shape`. Rive runtime
wired with graceful fallbacks. Fonts (Nunito, Outfit) bundled in
`static/fonts` and served from the same origin as the app bundle, with no
runtime requests to third-party services.
