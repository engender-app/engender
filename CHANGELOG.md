# Changelog

Every release gets a section here before it is tagged, and the release pipeline
reads it: `node scripts/release-notes.mjs` refuses a version with no section of
its own, and refuses a section that leaves one of the four call-outs
unanswered. Those four are what a person needs to know before installing an
update, and "none" is a perfectly good answer to any of them.

## Unreleased

Phase 2 is in progress and nothing has been released yet. Rename this heading
to the version before cutting the tag.

The Android app now enforces the same Content Security Policy the web app does.
It used to enforce only the part of it about scripts, because the rest arrived
in a web server header the Android build never sees.

The Android app no longer declares the INTERNET permission. It never made a
request to another origin, and now the permission list says so as well, which is
something a person can check for themselves rather than take on trust.

- Schema changes: none
- Archive format changes: none
- Security migrations: F-Droid signs rebuilt APKs with a different key than the GitHub/Play release pipeline, so cross-channel updates are reinstall + Archive restore, not in-place signature-compatible updates
- Minimum supported version: none, there is no earlier release to update from
