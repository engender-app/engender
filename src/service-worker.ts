/* The offline shell (phase 2, ticket 03; ADR-0021 has the reasoning).
   Everything the app needs to open without a network is precached under one
   key per release: the fallback document, the app's own chunks and CSS,
   SQLocal's worker and its copy of the SQLite WASM, the bundled woff2 faces
   and whatever else sits in static/ - the manifest's icons today, a .riv
   animation the moment one lands there.

   One directory in static/ is not that, and joins the cache later or never:
   the lab scanner's OCR engine, which shell-assets.ts holds the reasoning and
   the split for. A page that has loaded it asks for it, and both asks a page
   can make are in lib/pwa/sw-messages.ts.

   This worker still never decides for itself when to take over (phase 2
   ticket 04, which owns that decision): a new release installs quietly and
   waits, and the only thing that ends the wait early is a page asking through
   the message below. A page asks when the journal is idle and never while a
   write, a migration, an encryption conversion or an Archive import is in
   flight - lib/pwa/update.ts holds that rule and lib/data/journal-busy.ts
   is what it reads. clients.claim() stays absent for the same reason: a page
   that loaded on the old worker keeps it until it reloads itself. */
