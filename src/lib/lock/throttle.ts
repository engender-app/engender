/* The growing delay after wrong PIN attempts (ADR-0014). Deliberately not
   an attempt limit: nothing here ever wipes anything, because the only way
   to lose the journal has to be one the user chose (the reset action on
   the lock screen), not one a bored kid can trip into.

   Time comes in as an argument rather than from Date.now(), so the growth
   is testable without a clock and without a real hash - the throttle knows
   nothing about PINs.

   The count outlives the page, through the injected store. In memory it
   would not have raised the cost of guessing at all: the guesser is
   holding the device the lock screen is on, and reloading it is a gesture
   away. What no store can defend against is someone editing storage by
   hand, which is beside the point - that person can read the journal
   without ever meeting the lock screen (PRD). */
