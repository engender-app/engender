/* Getting the Journal's data key out of Android Keystore (ticket 13,
   ADR-0018).

   On the web a passphrase unwraps the key (data/journal-passphrase.ts). On
   Android nobody types anything: the key is wrapped by a Keystore key that
   cannot be used until the platform says someone authenticated, so this
   module asks, and reads the answer.

   The reading is the whole job, and it is written to fail closed. A key
   comes back only when the platform said `authenticated` AND handed over 64
   hex characters; every other combination - including the ones a bridge bug
   would produce, like a success with no key attached - is a refusal with
   something to do next. `biometric-outcome.ts` owns that vocabulary.

   One state is not a biometric state and is kept out of it: a Keystore key
   is destroyed when the screen lock it was bound to is removed, and no
   retry brings it back. Calling that a failed finger would loop somebody
   round the prompt for ever, so it comes back as `invalidated` and the gate
   offers the reset instead. */
