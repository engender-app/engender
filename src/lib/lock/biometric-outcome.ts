/* What the platform said, and what it means (ticket 13, ADR-0018).

   The Journal's data key is held by Android Keystore under a key that cannot
   be used until someone authenticates (ADR-0018: "Android protects that key
   through Android Keystore"). So this module is not deciding whether to show
   the journal - the Keystore has already decided, by refusing to unwrap. It
   is deciding what to say and what to offer next.

   That distinction is what keeps the ticket's warning from coming true. A bug
   here cannot unlock anything on its own, because a wrong answer still leaves
   the key wrapped. What a bug here can do is strand someone: tell them to
   retry a sensor that has no fingerprints on it, or offer nothing at all.
   Hence a closed set of outcomes, each with a way forward, and an unknown
   string treated as a failure rather than as a success. */
