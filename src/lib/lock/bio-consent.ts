/* Whether biometrics get offered before the person has said yes (ticket 18).

   `prefs.bioOptIn` is one flag read from two places - the device-bound boot
   gate (AndroidKeyGate) and the mid-session PIN pad (LockScreen) - and both
   ask the same three-way question of it: never answered, said yes, or said
   no. Pulled out as a plain function so that question is testable without
   either component, the way android-key.ts pulls the boot gate's own
   decision out of the bridge it reads. */
