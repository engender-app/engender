/* The Android key flow, tested where it can actually go wrong (ticket 13).

   The module under test is the one that turns "what the Keystore and the
   biometric prompt said" into "does the journal open". Every test here is
   written from the ticket's warning: a bug in this file must not be able to
   produce a data key, and must not be able to produce nothing at all.

   The bridge is a fake object rather than the real plugin, because what is
   interesting is the answers, not the transport. The Keystore itself is
   asserted on a device (JournalKeystoreTest). */
