/* Picking photos in an editor: the three steps ticket 11 left for ticket 08,
   in one place because both editors take them.

   Normalizing happens here rather than on save, so a file this app cannot
   read - HEIC, or something that is not an image at all - is refused while
   the picker is still the thing in front of the user, and so the tile can show
   what they actually chose. The bytes are stored when the entry or milestone
   is (ADR-0008: files land before the row that names them).

   It sits next to photoFiles.ts rather than in `data/`, for the same reason
   that one does: it reports failures by raising a toast, which is an app-level
   concern the data layer has no business knowing about. */
