/* Runs the real SQLite boot sequence once (ticket 04) and exposes its
   result reactively, so +layout.svelte can show a handled error state
   instead of a blank screen if opening the database or running migrations
   fails. This only runs in the browser (ssr = false).

   It is also the thin app-level module ADR-0017 asks for: the one place that
   constructs the journal over the driver and hands it to the UI. The driver
   stops here - screens reach the journal through data/live/, which is the
   only thing above this file that knows a database is involved at all.

   Two things arrive in two steps each, matching boot()'s own sequence.
   Preferences: the mirrored boot set is read synchronously before anything
   renders, so theme and palette match what the pre-paint script in app.html
   already stamped on <html>, then SQLite replaces the lot. Reference data:
   the built-ins are reconciled and the mirror filled at step 3, so the first
   screen to render already has a vocabulary. */
