/* Factor-impact correlation cards (phase 4 ticket 21, CONTEXT: "Dose
   event"). Phase 3's spec ruled out "scale-relationship or correlation
   analysis" outright; phase 4's spec revisits that call on purpose - a
   deliberate reversal, not scope drift the phase 3 decision missed.

   Two roles, not four independent factor kinds. The ticket names four
   factors a card can be built from - a tag, a dimension, a dose-log day,
   a mood value - but every one of its own examples ("dose day against
   mood", "a tag against a gender dimension") pairs an occurrence (a tag
   or a dose was logged that day) against a value (mood's or a
   dimension's day average). Modelling it as those two roles covers all
   four named factors as two of each, rather than needing a case for
   every pair among four.

   Ranked by normalized span (metricRange.ts's normalize(), the same rule
   stats.ts's recap() uses to pick its biggest dimension change) so a
   3-point move on a 0-10 dimension can outrank a 20-point move on a
   0-100 one - but every average a card carries stays native (ADR-0012);
   normalize() here only orders cards; it is never what's shown on one. */
