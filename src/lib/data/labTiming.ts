/* Where a lab draw fell relative to dosing (phase 4 ticket 03, CONTEXT:
   "Lab draw context"), and whether a chart's points were drawn under
   comparable conditions. Pure, and kept above the journal seam beside
   regimenEpisode.ts and doseSchedule.ts for the same reason: this is a
   question about a draw and a dose, not a row anyone stores. Nothing here
   reads a clock or a database - selectTimingDose (phase 8 features ticket
   37) does lean on regimenEpisode.ts and hormoneDrug.ts as real
   dependencies rather than peers, since picking which dose a draw's timing
   comes from is inseparable from whose drug that dose was.

   Purely descriptive throughout. This module answers "how long after which
   dose was this drawn" and stops: it names no draw time as better than
   another, no target value, and nothing about a result as favourable. The
   draw-timing helper that would have advised one was rejected outright at
   the phase 4 grilling session (Q15); this records what it would have had
   to know, without the advice. */
