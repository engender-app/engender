/* The rune-free half of the tableVersions seam (ticket 27): the
   write-announcement notify.

   `tableVersions.svelte.ts` owns the reactive version state and, being
   rune-bearing, cannot be reached by the Node tier (`$state` is not defined
   there, ADR-0017) - the same reason writes.ts is split out from
   journal.svelte.ts. The subscribe/announce rule the reference mirror leans
   on has no runes in it, so it lives here where a Node test can exercise it.

   After a write, `tableVersions.bump` announces through the shared instance;
   the mirror in reference.svelte.ts subscribes with `onTablesWritten` to
   re-read what it holds. Queries need nothing from here - the version bump
   reaches them through `$state`. */
