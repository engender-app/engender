/* Which tables each journal mutation writes, and a wrapper that announces
   them once the write has landed (ticket 08).

   ADR-0004 splits reads by size: reference data is mirrored and entry data
   is queried asynchronously. Both halves need the same thing from a write -
   to be told what just changed - and neither should have to ask the screen
   that performed it. A screen calling `journal.entries.upsertEntry` cannot
   be relied on to remember that Home's list, the streak, the calendar and
   the stats charts all read that table; miss one and it shows yesterday's
   answer with no sign that it is doing so.

   So the announcement is taken off the call sites and attached to the
   journal itself. Everything above reads through the wrapper, and the
   invalidation is as scoped as this table is precise: editing a lab result
   leaves the entry queries alone.

   Rune-free on purpose, like the journal below it (ADR-0017): the mapping is
   the part with a rule in it, and the Node tier can only test what has no
   `$state` in it. The reactive half is journal.svelte.ts, which supplies
   `onWrite`.

   Unclassified operations are rejected outright rather than assumed to be
   reads. A read misfiled as a write costs a needless re-query; a write
   misfiled as a read shows stale data forever, and the failure looks like a
   Svelte bug rather than a missing line here. */
