/* When the next scheduled fixed-position hair photo is due (phase 4 ticket
   09). Pure, kept above the journal seam beside doseSchedule.ts: nothing
   here reads a clock or a database, and no due date is stored (ADR-0010) -
   the hair-progress screen recomputes it from the anchor and the last photo
   taken on every read.

   Progression here is slow enough that unscheduled photos would under-
   sample it (ticket 09), so a photo is due on a fixed recurring interval
   rather than logged ad hoc. The interval is a plain constant, not a
   per-person setting: the ticket does not ask for one to be configurable,
   and inventing that knob would be exactly the speculative flexibility
   CLAUDE.md's simplicity rule warns against. */

/** The next due day, or null with no anchor yet - there is nothing to count
    weeks since (ticket 09's "unanchored" case: staging and photo capture
    still work, just without this framing).

    With no photo taken yet, the first is due on the anchor day itself - a
    baseline shot as soon as treatment has a start date. After that, due is
    `HAIR_PHOTO_INTERVAL_DAYS` after the last photo actually taken, not
    stepped from the anchor: stepping from the anchor would leave every
    later photo perpetually "overdue" the moment one photo lands late, the
    same reason doseSchedule.ts's expectedSlots does not re-anchor to when a
    schedule was edited. */
