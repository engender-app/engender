/* Remaining medication stock and its run-out projection (phase 4 ticket 04,
   CONTEXT: pending - "Regimen episode", "Dose event", "Dose pause"). Pure,
   kept above the journal seam beside doseSchedule.ts and labTiming.ts:
   nothing here reads a clock or a database, and both figures are derived
   on read rather than stored (ADR-0010) - the schema comment at
   medication_stock's own migration (v7) argues why a decremented number
   would drift the way `reminder.trigger_time` did, and why that is not
   ticket 03's stored-context exception: every dose this projects over is
   still sitting in `dose_event`, unlike the dose log a lab draw's context
   was measured against.

   Scoped by drug (free text on RegimenEpisode.drug), matched exactly the
   way an analyte's unit or a lab provider is (CONTEXT: "Analyte", "Lab
   provider") - not by regimen episode, because a dose or route change on
   the same drug starts a new episode, and an episode-scoped count would go
   stale on the very next adjustment.

   The trailing consumption rate deliberately does not reach for
   dose_schedule or dose_pause, the way labTiming.ts's day-of-interval does
   not reach for dose_schedule: a schedule is optional and one per episode,
   so a figure that depended on one would silently go missing for someone
   who has never set one (labTiming.ts's own reasoning). Working the pause
   case through shows a second reason, in the opposite direction from the
   one that reasoning might suggest: excluding a pause's days from the
   trailing window - mirroring how adherence() excludes them from the
   expected-slot count - raises the rate back to the non-paused pace and
   projects an EARLIER run-out, which is backwards. Nothing is being
   consumed while a pause runs, so the stock lasts longer in calendar time,
   not less. Leaving every calendar day in the denominator - counting a
   pause exactly like a run of skipped doses, both zero-consumption days
   that pull the average down - is what pushes the date later, which is
   the direction box 3 asks for. */
