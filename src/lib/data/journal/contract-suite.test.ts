/* The contract suite over node:sqlite (ticket 11).

   This is the baseline the Android tier has to match: the same suite runs on
   a phone from tests/android-tier/, over SQLCipher through the Capacitor
   bridge, and both are expected to report every check passing. Running it
   here as well is what keeps it honest - a suite that only ever runs on the
   slow tier rots between the runs that would have caught it. */
