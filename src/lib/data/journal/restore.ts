/* Reading an archive back into the journal: Replace and Merge (ticket 14,
   ADR-0011, PRD F14). The inverse of archive.ts's snapshot, and part of the
   same area - one journal operation each, so no caller holds a transaction
   and no caller sequences the areas itself (ADR-0017). It sits in its own
   file because the two halves share nothing but the wire format: one reads
   every table out by travelling identity, this one writes every table back.

   The order of operations is the whole ticket:

     1. Write every photo file the archive carries. Names are uuid-based
        (ADR-0008), so a file being written cannot collide with one already
        there, which is what makes writing before deciding anything safe.
     2. In one transaction: reconcile the built-in vocabulary,
        unconditionally and first, then swap the journal. Key identity makes
        the reconcile idempotent, and it runs before either mode applies
        because a Replace must not be able to leave the journal short of a
        built-in the archive's own rows reference. It is inside the same
        transaction so that a failure leaves the database exactly as it was,
        rather than as the next boot would have made it.

   Nothing here deletes a file, ever (ADR-0011). Every failure before the
   commit is therefore a no-op: the old journal is completely intact and the
   only cost is dead files until the next boot's orphan sweep reclaims them
   (photos.ts). Deleting up front would mean a failure part way leaves the
   user with neither their old photos nor the new ones, on a device that by
   design has no other copy.

   Merge adds what this device does not have and leaves matched rows alone,
   matching by uuid for the user's own rows and by key for built-ins
   (ADR-0002) - so re-importing the same archive changes nothing. Skip-
   existing rather than last-write-wins, because LWW needs trustworthy clocks
   across two devices with no sync protocol and its failure mode is silent: a
   fix made on this device would vanish under an older archive.

   Replace discards this device's journal rows and installs the archive's,
   then writes the archive's state onto the built-in rows it kept. Preferences
   are not the journal's (ADR-0003) and nothing here touches the pref table,
   which is what leaves the PIN, the app-lock flags and the disguise settings
   in place through the most destructive path in the app.

   What the rows contain is validated by the schema as they are written, which
   is why every insert is inside the transaction: a value the columns refuse -
   a reminder with no rule, an entry with no day - rolls the whole import back
   and leaves the journal as it was. Only the payload's shape is checked up
   front, because a collection that is not an array would otherwise fail as a
   TypeError that reads like a bug in this file rather than like a damaged
   file on disk. */
