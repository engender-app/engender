/* Voice recording staging (ticket 24, CONTEXT: "Voice recording"). Entry-only,
   unlike photos.ts: ticket 24 excludes milestones, so there is one owner
   column and no owner to resolve - the caller (entries.ts) already holds a
   real entry id by the time it stages a recording, the same way it already
   holds one when it stages a photo.

   The same file-before-row / row-before-file ordering photos.ts's header
   states applies here, over the same injected PhotoFileStore: a recording is
   exactly the kind of binary blob that store already exists to carry, so
   this reuses it rather than standing up a second one. No thumbnail and
   no normalize() step (out of scope: no client-side audio effects) - a
   recording is the bytes MediaRecorder produced, written through as-is. */
