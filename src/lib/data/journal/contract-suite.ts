/* The checks a driver has to pass to be a driver, written once and run on
   every tier (ticket 11).

   The Node tier runs them over node:sqlite and the Android tier runs them
   over SQLCipher through the Capacitor bridge, against the same journal
   code and the same assertions. That is the point: ADR-0017's seam is only
   real if the thing above it cannot tell the platforms apart, and the way
   to know is to ask both the same questions rather than to write each tier
   its own probe and hope they stayed comparable.

   It is framework-free on purpose. vitest cannot run in a WebView on a
   phone, so a suite expressed in `test()` and `assert` could not be the
   same suite in both places - which is how the browser tier ended up with
   hand-written probes that resemble the Node tests without being them.

   Scope: the behaviours that depend on the SQLite build or on the driver
   contract, not the journal's whole surface. Business rules that are pure
   TypeScript above the driver are already covered by the Node tier and
   would run identically here by construction. What varies by platform is
   what this asks about - FTS5, window functions, folding, the change
   counts, transaction rollback, and preferences over the same table. */
