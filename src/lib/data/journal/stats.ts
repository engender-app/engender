/* The stats area (ticket 10, ADR-0012): every aggregate the stats screen,
   the calendar and the recap read, computed in SQL and returned in native
   units.

   Native units is the rule this module is built around. Mood comes back on
   1 to 5 because that is what was logged; a dimension comes back within its
   own range. Nothing here rescales anything to make two metrics look alike -
   that job belongs to metricRange.ts, whose output drives colour and is
   never shown as a number. The demo store mixed the two and ended up
   answering "the metric's average" with mood, with mood x 20, and with mood
   x 20 again from three different functions.

   Ranges arrive as two epoch days rather than a length in days, and the
   streak takes today as an argument: the journal never reads the clock for
   a domain answer, so every case here is a plain deterministic fixture.

   Nothing is stored. A recap is recomputed from entries, tags, milestones
   and dimension values every time it is opened (ADR-0010). */

         total subtracted from the range's total is exactly the "without"
         total. Two keys are what make that a partition rather than an
