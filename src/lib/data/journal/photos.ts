/* The photos area (PRD F5/F27, ADR-0008). One table and one code path for
   both owners: an entry's photos and a milestone's photo differ only in
   which column the row hangs off, so there is no second implementation for
   milestones to drift from this one.

   Order is the rule that carries this module. Files land before the row
   that names them, and the row goes before the files are forgotten:

     attach  - write both files, then insert the row.
     remove  - delete the row, then delete the files.

   Either way a crash in the gap leaves a file no row references, never a
   row pointing at a file that is not there. The first is reclaimed by
   sweepOrphanPhotos() below; the second would be a photo the user can see
   in the list and never open. That asymmetry is ADR-0011's rule - import
   writes files first and never deletes - applied to the ordinary path.

   deleteEntry and deleteMilestone follow the same order for the rows they
   own, and hand their file paths to removeFilesOf() here so the rule about
   what a photo's files are lives in one place. */

/* Deletes every file in the store that no photo row references, on boot,
   after the database opens (ADR-0008). This is the other half of the
   ordering rule at the top of this file: attach, remove, deleteEntry and
   ticket 14's import are all free to leave a loose file behind, because
   this reclaims it on the next start. It is the only code that deletes a
   file nobody asked to delete, which is why it reads the rows itself
   rather than trusting a caller's list.

   A row names only its full photo; the thumbnail's name is derived
   (names.ts), so both sides of the comparison have to be expanded or
   every thumbnail would look like an orphan.

   It is also why the store's root is a directory of its own and never the
   OPFS root: the database file lives in OPFS too, and no row references
   it.

   Reads `hair_photo` (migrations.ts v13), `voice_recording` (migrations.ts
   v17), `video_note` (migrations.ts v30) and `tryout_photo` (migrations.ts
   v31) as well as `photo`: a hair-progress photo's row lives in its own
   table (journal/hairProgress.ts), a voice recording's in its own
   (journal/voiceRecordings.ts), a video note's in its own
   (journal/videoNotes.ts) and a tryout photo's in its own
   (journal/tryouts.ts), neither as a third owner here, but every kind of
   file sits in the same store and would otherwise look orphaned the
   moment this ran. Neither a recording nor a video note has a thumbnail
   to derive, so their file names are read straight rather than through
   filesOf(): that helper's `thumbFileName()` only rewrites a `.jpg`
   suffix (names.ts), so calling it on a `.webm` name would leave it
   unchanged and add the same name to the referenced set twice for no
   reason.

   Precondition: nothing may attach a photo while this runs. It reads the
   rows and then lists the files, so a photo whose files landed after the
   read but whose row landed before the list would look like an orphan.

   Enforced rather than assumed since phase 5 audit ticket 02 took this off
   boot's critical path: boot is still the only caller, but it no longer runs
   before any screen can write, so the guard every journal write raises is what
   the precondition rests on now (watchJournalWrites, journal-busy.ts). A write
   in flight at any point means this stops where it is and leaves the rest to
   the next boot - the same outcome its failure path has always had, and the
   right way round: losing a photo's bytes is not a price worth paying to
   reclaim a file nothing was reading. */
