/* The medication stock area (phase 4 ticket 04, CONTEXT: "Medication stock",

   stockProjection.ts): remaining stock and its run-out projection are both
   derived on read, never stored (ADR-0046, generalizing ADR-0010's rule).

   Reads doses through DosesArea and episodes through RegimenArea, and
   writes the run-out reminder through RemindersArea, rather than
   querying those tables itself the way archive.ts does: this area is a
   view stitched together from rows two other areas own, not a second
   owner for either one. Routing every reminder write through
   RemindersArea.upsertReminder keeps assertValidRule and the schema's own
   CHECK the one place a reminder rule is validated, the same guarantee
   ticket 02's dose log gets from attributeDose rather than re-deriving
   attribution itself. */
