/* The hormone curve area (phase 4 ticket 10, CONTEXT: "Hormone curve"). A
   view stitched together from rows `doses`, `regimen` and `labs` own, the
   same way exposure.ts is: this area owns no table, reads no driver, and
   stores nothing (ADR-0010). Every band is recomputed from the dose log on
   every read.

   The lab results are the point of the screen rather than a decoration on
   it. The model is a population-level estimate and a lab result is a
   measurement of one person, so the results are what the curve is drawn
   around: they carry their own native value and unit (ADR-0026) and they are
   what the optional scale factor is fitted to. Nothing here compares a
   result to a target, because there is no target in this app to compare it
   to. */
