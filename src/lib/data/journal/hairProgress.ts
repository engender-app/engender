/* The hair-progress area (phase 4 ticket 09): self-staging against a
   published scale, and scheduled fixed-position photos.

   Stages are a dated series like measurement (ticket 08) - a person
   re-stages over time, never replacing one date's value in place. No
   episode or anchor reference: what a screen reads staging and photos
   against is resolved above this seam (hairAnchor.ts's
   hairAnchorEpochDay), the same reason personalEffects.ts and
   measurements.ts carry none either.

   Hair photos are their own table rather than a third owner on `photo`
   (migrations.ts v13 explains why: SQLite cannot widen that table's
   exactly-one-owner CHECK without a full rebuild). The shared pipeline is
   still reused exactly as ticket 09 asks: stagePhoto (photos.ts) writes the
   same normalized, metadata-stripped bytes through the same
   file-before-row order, and removeFilesOf reclaims them the same way on
   delete - only the row naming the files lives here. */
