/* Preferences, held in SQLite's `pref` key-value table (ADR-0009).

   The factory takes its driver and returns the module (ADR-0017); there is
   no module-level current driver and nothing here imports an ambient
   handle, so a test constructs its own instance the same way boot does.

   Reads are synchronous because screens read preferences during render:
   opening loads every row once, and the in-memory copy is kept in step by
   the writes that go through here. SQLite stays authoritative - reopening
   throws the in-memory copy away and reads the table again.

   The optional cache is the small mirror outside SQLite (localStorage on
   web, Capacitor Preferences on Android) holding the boot set. It is
   refreshed on every write, never read except by boot, and never treated
   as authoritative. */
