/* The one preference object screens read and write.

   preferences.ts is async and rune-free so it can be tested in the Node
   tier; a Svelte template needs a synchronous, reactive read and a plain
   assignment it can `bind:` to. This is the thin layer between the two: a
   $state projection of the pref table, with writes forwarded to SQLite.

   It is a projection, not a second store. Nothing else caches a preference
   and nothing writes to `values` except this module, so `activeScales`
   cannot end up with two sources of truth while the demo store still owns
   entries (ticket 07 takes those).

   Three phases in a cold start, in order:

     1. Nothing attached. Values are the defaults, then the boot set from
        the cache once boot() reaches step 1. A write here is remembered
        and replayed - onboarding is reachable before SQLite finishes
        opening, and losing the name the user just typed would be its own
        bug.
     2. attachPreferences() lands the real values from SQLite.
     3. Writes go straight through. */
