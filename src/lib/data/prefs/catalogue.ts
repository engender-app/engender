/* Every preference the app has, with its default and its two memberships.
   Kept free of imports so both tiers and the pre-database boot path can
   read it.

   Two lists, and they deliberately do not line up:

   - Portable vs device-local (ADR-0003) decides whether a preference
     travels inside an export archive. It is an allowlist: a preference
     added later is device-local until someone puts it in PORTABLE_KEYS on
     purpose, so nothing leaks into an archive by accident.
   - The boot set (ADR-0009) decides whether a preference is mirrored
     outside SQLite, and its one question is different: is this needed
     before the database is open? Theme, palette and language must apply on
     first paint; the lock flags shape the passphrase gate that renders
     before the database can be unlocked (ticket 09). The mirror lives in
     plaintext localStorage, so nothing sensitive may join it: the PIN hash
     used to be here for the pre-database lock screen, and moved back
     behind encryption when the passphrase gate took that slot - a 4-digit
     hash beside the ciphertext is an offline-guessable secret (ADR-0018
     names sensitive boot preferences as covered). `bioOptIn` (ticket 18) is
     also in the boot set for the same "needed before the database opens"
     reason - the Android device-bound gate has to decide whether to auto-fire
     the platform prompt before there is a database to read the answer from -
     but it is a plain yes/no/unasked flag rather than a secret, so plaintext
     costs nothing the way a PIN hash would.

   catalogue.test.ts fails if a preference lands in neither of the first
   two lists. */
