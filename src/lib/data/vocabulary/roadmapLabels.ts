/* Wording for the transition roadmap (phase 4 ticket 23): a track name, a
   pack name, and a title plus an optional note per goal. roadmap.ts holds
   the keys and takes no paraglide, the same split builtins.ts and this
   file's neighbour labels.ts keep (ADR-0002, ADR-0016).

   The title map is a full Record over every bundled goal key, so a goal
   added to a pack without wording is a typecheck failure rather than a raw
   key on screen. Notes are Partial on purpose: a social step like telling
   one person has nothing procedural to add, and a forced note there would
   be filler.

   The Polish pack's legal and procedural wording was checked against
   tranzycja.pl (the step-by-step guides on medical transition, the court
   case and the USC name change), the Supreme Court's own announcement of
   resolution III CZP 6/24 of 4 March 2025, the Ombudsman's guide to
   ustalenie plci proceedings, and the relevant gov.pl pages, on the date
   POLISH_PACK.reviewedOn records. What that check turned up is said out
   loud in roadmap_caveat_pl rather than hidden: there is still no gender
   recognition statute, whether identity alone grounds a change is pending
   before the Supreme Court as III CZP 20/26, and the recorded sex marker
   itself only ever holds K or M, so no procedure produces a third value.

   Every item describes procedure. None of them tells anyone what to do
   about their own case, which is the ticket's out-of-scope line and the
   reason the notes carry deadlines and fees rather than recommendations. */
