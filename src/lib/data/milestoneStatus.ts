/* How a milestone reads against a given day: counting down to it, landing
   on it, or looking back at it (PRD F6/F26).

   Nothing here is stored (ADR-0010) - the schema has no `kind` column, and
   whether a day is a countdown or an anniversary is a question about today,
   which changes overnight. It also sits above the journal rather than in it,
   for the reason ticket 10 gives about every dated read: "today" is a local
   calendar day (ADR-0001) and the data layer has no business deciding which
   one it is. So today arrives as an argument, and every case here is a plain
   fixture.

   Four screens asked this question before and one of them answered it
   differently (settings/milestones grew its own copy of the wording); the
   wording still belongs to the screens, but the arithmetic is here. */
