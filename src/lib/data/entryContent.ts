/* The entry invariant (CONTEXT: "Entry"): an entry holds at least one of
   mood, a dimension value, a tag, a non-blank note, a photo, a voice
   recording, a body-region intensity - or it does not exist. One predicate,
   because it is enforced in the journal, again in the demo-store repository
   for the ticket 07-to-08 window, and echoed by the editor's save guard -
   three sites that must never drift.

   `recordingCount` joined the other six at ticket 24: a voice recording is
   first-class entry media alongside a photo, so a recording-only entry is
   as valid as a photo-only one already was. `videoCount` joined at phase 5
   ticket 22 on the same grounds - a video note is the third citizen of that
   set, so a video-only entry is a real entry too. */
