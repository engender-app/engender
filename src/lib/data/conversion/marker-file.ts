/* Where the web keeps the conversion marker (ticket 10): one small JSON
   file in the OPFS root, beside the keystore whose ordering against it is
   the whole recovery story (conversion.ts).

   It holds a stage name and nothing else. There is no Journal content in
   it, nothing derived from the passphrase and nothing worth protecting -
   which is just as well, because it has to be readable before the database
   can be opened, and readable by a boot that may never get a data key at
   all. Its own existence is not a secret either: an unfinished conversion
   is visible from the plaintext file sitting beside it regardless.

   An unreadable or unrecognised file reads as "no conversion in progress".
   That is the safe answer: with a plaintext Journal present the app offers
   the conversion again from the start, and the source it would convert is
   untouched either way. */
