/* The conversion's ports, on the web (ticket 10). Each one is a single
   platform capability; the order they are called in, and what a kill
   between any two of them leaves behind, is conversion.ts's business and is
   tested without a browser at all.

   The two databases never overlap in the pool. The source is a
   `engender.sqlite3` file in the OPFS root, which only SQLocal can read
   (ADR-0020 replaced the driver, not the file format), and the target lives
   inside the SAHPool directory under the same name - so the conversion
   reads with one library, writes with the other, and neither can be
   mistaken for the other's file. What they cannot do is hold the pool at
   the same time: SAHPool's sync access handles belong to one worker, so
   every port here opens what it needs and closes it again rather than
   keeping a connection alive across stages. */
