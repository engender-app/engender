/* Converting a plaintext-era Journal into an encrypted one (ticket 10).

   Every Journal written before ticket 09 is a `gender-diary.sqlite3` file in
   the OPFS root with a directory of plaintext photos beside it. This module
   is the state machine that turns one into the encrypted Journal ticket 09
   defined, on a phone, where the process can be killed between any two
   statements and the disk can be full.

   The rule that shapes all of it: nothing plaintext is destroyed until the
   encrypted copy has been reopened under the data key and counted against
   the original. Everything before that point is additive, so a kill leaves
   the previous Journal exactly as it was. Everything after it is
   forward-only, and every step is idempotent, so a kill leaves a conversion
   that finishes itself on the next boot.

   The marker file is what makes those two halves distinguishable after a
   kill, and its order against the keystore is load-bearing. The marker is
   written FIRST, before the passphrase is even chosen: a keystore beside a
   plaintext Journal with no marker would be indistinguishable from an
   encrypted Journal with a stray file next to it, and the app would have to
   guess which of the two databases is the real one.

     marker 'preparing'  a keystore may or may not exist; no journal data has
                         moved. Killed here, the plaintext Journal is whole.
     marker 'database'   an encrypted copy is being written, and may be
                         partial. The source is untouched, so a resume
                         throws the copy away and writes it again - a
                         complete-but-unverified copy is indistinguishable
                         from a partial one, and redoing it is cheaper than
                         a mechanism that could tell them apart.
     marker 'photos'     the copy is complete AND verified. This is the point
                         of no return: photo files are rewritten in place
                         from here, so there is no going back to the
                         plaintext Journal - and nothing to go back for,
                         because the encrypted one is proven. A resume
                         finishes the photos that are still plaintext.
     marker 'retire'     everything is converted. What is left is deleting
                         the plaintext files, by name. A resume deletes the
                         rest.
     no marker           done.

   ADR-0006 keeps a pre-migration copy until the next clean boot. Here the
   pre-conversion state IS the source database, and it is retired as soon as
   the conversion is proven rather than one boot later: ADR-0018 cannot claim
   an encrypted Journal while a readable copy of the same Journal is sitting
   in OPFS, and a copy that has already been verified page for page has
   nothing left to insure against.

   Everything the machine touches is a port, so the whole of it - every
   stage, every kill, every resume - runs in the Node tier against real
   SQLite and an in-memory store (conversion.test.ts). The web wiring is in
   web-ports.ts and the real platform is proved once, end to end, by the
   browser tier. */
