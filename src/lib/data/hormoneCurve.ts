/* The injectable-ester hormone curve (phase 4 ticket 10, CONTEXT: "Hormone
   curve"). Pure, above the journal seam, no clock and no paraglide
   (ADR-0016), like exposureCounters.ts beside it: the curve is recomputed
   from the dose log and the regimen episode history every time it is asked
   for and nothing about it is stored (ADR-0010).

   The model is the three-compartment first-order cascade - ester in the
   injection depot, ester in serum, estradiol in serum - whose single-dose
   solution is

     C(t) = dose * d * k1 * k2 * (  e^-k1t / ((k1-k2)(k1-k3))
                                  - e^-k2t / ((k1-k2)(k2-k3))
                                  + e^-k3t / ((k1-k3)(k2-k3)) )

   for t >= 0 and 0 before the injection. Repeated injections are plain
   superposition of shifted single-dose curves, and `dose` multiplies the
   whole thing, which is where linear dose scaling within an ester comes
   from - it is the equation's own shape, not an extra step. Parameters and
   their provenance are in hormoneCurveModels.ts.

   Two things this deliberately does not do.

   It never produces a single value for a moment in time. Every answer is a
   band, because the parameters are a posterior and not a measurement: the
   5th and 95th percentile across the 313 samples, taken over the whole
   superposed curve per sample so the band stays a set of plausible curves
   rather than an envelope of unrelated points. bandMidpointAt exists for
   the scale-factor fit and says in its own doc that it is not for drawing.

   It does not handle the case of two rate constants being equal, which
   makes the denominators above zero. The published posteriors do not go
   there: across all 1565 samples the closest two rate constants come within
   0.52% of each other, which is far from the cancellation that would need
   the limit forms. A guard that cannot fire would just be a claim that this
   was checked, so the check is written down here instead. */
