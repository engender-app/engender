/* Normalizing a picked photo (ADR-0008, ADR-0015).

   One function, one input (the raw bytes), one output (JPEG bytes plus a
   thumbnail). It knows nothing about where the bytes came from or where
   they are going, which is what lets the same call serve the web file
   input, the Android picker and ticket 14's import.

   Everything ADR-0008 and ADR-0015 ask for falls out of one decode and one
   re-encode:

     - Re-encoded to JPEG, so the 4-12MB the camera produced does not go
       into every future archive.
     - Capped at 2048px on the long edge, never upscaled.
     - All metadata gone. Not stripped tag by tag - a canvas has no way to
       carry EXIF through, so re-encoding through one is what drops GPS,
       device identifiers and the rest.
     - Orientation baked into the pixels, because the decode asks for
       imageOrientation: 'from-image'. It has to happen in this order: the
       rotation is applied while decoding, and the tag that described it is
       gone by the time the canvas is encoded. Skip it and every photo an
       iPhone took sideways stores sideways.

   This is browser-only - it needs a decoder and a canvas - so the Node
   tier tests the pieces that are pure (bytes.ts) and the browser tier
   tests this against a real Chromium. */
