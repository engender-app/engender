/* What a photo journey export is made of, before any pixels exist (ticket
   27).

   The whole export is two steps the user takes separately: generate, then
   share. This module is everything the first step can decide without a
   canvas - which photos are in, how big the collage has to be, how long
   the timelapse will run, what the file ends up called - so the screen can
   show a count and a duration before anything is encoded, and so the
   geometry is under Node-tier tests rather than only visible in a picture
   somebody has to look at. journey-render.ts is the half that needs a
   browser.

   Nothing here reads or writes a photo file. The bytes it works out
   dimensions for are the ones normalize() already produced on import
   (ADR-0008: JPEG, 2048px on the long edge), which is all the export ever
   consumes - there is no original left to go back to (ADR-0015). */

    in order, and filtering preserves it. Both ends of the range are
    inclusive, because both ends are days a person picked in a date field

/* --- the collage ---------------------------------------------------------

   A contact sheet: square cells in chronological reading order, each with
   its date underneath. Square because the photos are not all the same
   shape and a grid of mixed aspect ratios has ragged holes in it - the
   cell crops to its centre (fitCover) instead.

   The nominal numbers below are what a short journey gets. A long one scales
   the whole layout down by one factor rather than growing without limit: a
   canvas has a maximum area, and it is smaller on a phone than on a desktop,
   so a three-year journey of 400 photos has to arrive at a picture that
   exists at all. */

/** The pixel area no collage may exceed.

    Area rather than a long edge, because area is the limit a canvas actually
    has: mobile builds refuse one over about 16.7M pixels (2**24), and the
    dimension ceiling is an order of magnitude away from anything a grid of
    photos produces. Capping the edge at 4096 instead looked equivalent and
    was not - the grid is near square, so a 101-photo journey landed at
    4020x4087, which is 16.4M and inside the limit by two per cent. 12M keeps
    a real margin and still gives a 100-photo journey 300px cells. */

   One square frame per photo, letterboxed rather than cropped: a timelapse
   is watched one photo at a time, so there is no grid to keep tidy and no
   reason to throw away the edges of a portrait shot.

   often the picture changes - each photo is held for MS_PER_PHOTO, so the
