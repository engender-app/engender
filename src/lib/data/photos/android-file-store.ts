/* The Android PhotoFileStore (ticket 12): app-private files through the
   local Photos plugin. Names stay opaque and relative exactly as on web.

   Reads fetch from Capacitor's local server, which keeps the bytes binary
   from disk to Uint8Array and is bound by the disk rather than by the
   bridge (ticket 07) - a plugin response crosses into the WebView as a JSON
   string, and on a Pixel 10a that crossing moved photo bytes at 0.8MB/s
   however they were batched, which made a decade of photos take seven
   minutes to read for an Archive export.

   Writes measured the same 0.8MB/s (ticket 17: an archive restore writing
   750 files spent 97% of its time in this call), because the local server
   only serves files - it has no matching path for the WebView to hand bytes
   back in. `writeOverChannel` is that path's own fix: a WebMessageListener
   carries the bytes across as a structured-clone ArrayBuffer, which never
   becomes a JSON string (ticket 19). Below the WebView versions that carry
   it, `window.androidPhotoWriteChannel` does not exist and this falls back
   to the base64 bridge call exactly as it always has - the same shape as
   `Object.hasOwn` and `crypto.randomUUID`'s fallbacks (ADR-0023). */
