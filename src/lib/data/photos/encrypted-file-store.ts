/* Per-file encryption for what lives outside SQLite (ticket 09, ADR-0020's
   consequence): photos and thumbnails are files, so whole-database
   encryption never reaches them. This decorator wraps any PhotoFileStore -
   OPFS on web, app-private files on Android - and encrypts each file with
   AES-256-GCM under the same random data key that keys the database
   (ADR-0018).

   The file's name is the additional authenticated data, so a ciphertext
   moved to another name fails decryption instead of decoding as the wrong
   photo. Stored form: nonce, then ciphertext, nothing else - GCM's tag
   already authenticates, so no separate header or magic is needed, and
   size() can answer the plaintext length by arithmetic instead of a read
   (packing an archive asks for every photo's length up front, ADR-0007).

   remove() and list() pass through untouched: names were opaque uuids
   before encryption and stay so, which is what keeps the orphan sweep and
   delete working with no idea encryption exists. */
