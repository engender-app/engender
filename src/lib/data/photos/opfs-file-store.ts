/* The web PhotoFileStore: files in OPFS, in a directory of the app's own.

   The directory matters. SQLocal keeps the database file in the OPFS root,
   and the orphan sweep deletes everything it finds that no photo row
   references - pointed at the root, it would delete the database on the
   next boot. Photos get their own subdirectory so "everything here" is a
   safe thing for the sweep to ask.

   Names stay opaque and relative on both sides of the seam (names.ts):
   this adapter is the only code that knows what root they resolve
   against, which is what lets the Android adapter resolve the same names
   against the app-private directory later without anything above noticing. */
