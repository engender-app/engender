/* Turning a photo journey into one file (ticket 27).

   The browser half of journey.ts: it needs a decoder, a canvas and - for
   the timelapse - MediaRecorder, so it is tested against a real Chromium in
   the browser tier rather than stubbed in Node, the same split normalize.ts
   already lives under.

   Both outputs read one photo at a time and let it go before the next. A
   three-year journey can be hundreds of photos and every stored one is up
   to 2048px on the long edge (ADR-0008), which is 16MB of bitmap each -
   decoding them all first would be the export that runs out of memory on
   the phone it matters on.

   Nothing here writes a file anywhere. It hands back a Blob and the screen
   decides what happens to it, which is the whole point of the ticket: the
   generated picture only leaves the device when a person does something
   about it. */
