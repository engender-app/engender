/* Choosing a photo to add.

   One seam, two platforms. On the web this is a file input; on Android it
   is Capacitor's photo picker, which hands back the one photo the user
   chose without ever asking for the read-the-whole-gallery permission
   (ticket 11). The Android half lands with the shell - what matters now is
   that the call sites above never learn which one they got.

   Bytes, not File objects or URIs: a File is a web type and a content://
   URI is an Android one, and normalize() takes neither. */
