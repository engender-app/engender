/* The JS side of ticket 19's fast write path: a small MessageChannel
   handshake against `window.androidPhotoWriteChannel`, which native
   registers with `WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener` when the WebView can
   carry an ArrayBuffer across as a structured clone (PhotoWriteChannel.java
   has the other half and the full protocol).

   `globalThis` rather than `window`: they are the same object in a WebView,
   and this keeps the module reachable from a plain Node test with
   `vi.stubGlobal`, the same way android-file-store.test.ts already stubs
   `fetch`. */
