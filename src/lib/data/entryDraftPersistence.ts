/* What survives EntryEditor.svelte across an Android process death (ticket
   14): a plain, JSON-safe snapshot of the draft's editable fields, matched
   back to whichever entry/day it belongs to and reapplied on top of a
   freshly created draft. Rune-free, tested under the Node tier like
   entryDraft.ts.

   Picked photos' raw bytes are deliberately not part of the snapshot - a
   localStorage mirror has no room for full-resolution JPEGs, so an unsaved
   photo attachment does not survive a killed process. A removal of an
   already-stored photo does survive, since that is just an id. A recording
   just made (ticket 24) gets the same treatment as a picked photo, for the
   same reason: its bytes are not small either, and a removed stored
   recording's id survives the same way a removed stored photo's does. */
