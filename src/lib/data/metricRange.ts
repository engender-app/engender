/* The one place a native value turns into colour (ADR-0012).

   Two value concepts live in this app and they must never be confused.
   Every number a person sees stays in native units - mood 1 to 5, a gender
   dimension within its own range - and the journal only ever returns
   those. A normalized 0-to-1 value exists so that mood and a 0-10 custom
   dimension shade comparably on the calendar heat-map and the week strip,
   and it is never displayed.

   Import-free on purpose: the journal picks the recap's biggest dimension
   change by normalized magnitude (comparing a 0-100 dimension against a
   0-10 one any other way is meaningless) while reporting the change
   natively, and the journal may not import anything above its seam. */
