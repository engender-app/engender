/* Regimen episode resolution (CONTEXT: "Regimen episode", ADR-0010): a
   pure question over a list of episodes and a timestamp, kept above the
   journal seam the same way milestoneStatus.ts is - nothing here reads a
   clock or a database, so downstream tickets (02 onward) call it against
   whatever episodes journal.regimen.getEpisodes() already returned, rather
   than each re-deriving "which episode was this logged under".

   An episode's end is never stored (ADR-0010): it is the day before the
   next episode's start, or "ongoing" for the latest one, which is what
   lets a retroactive correction (a new episode inserted with a past start
   date) change every affected record's attribution just by changing which
   episode sorts where - no migration, no stored link to rewrite. */

/** Which episode was in effect at `timestamp`: the latest one whose start
    day is on or before the epoch day `timestamp` falls on. `episodes` must
    be sorted ascending by `startEpochDay` (ties broken by insertion order),
    which is the order journal.regimen.getEpisodes() already returns them
    in - the last qualifying entry in that order is the answer, so no
    comparison of ids or "now" is needed. Hidden episodes still resolve:
    hiding takes an episode out of pickers, not out of history, and a
    record logged under one keeps resolving to it. */

    timeline anchors against this and nothing else, so the anchor does not

    in the same sorted order resolveEpisodeAt expects; hidden episodes
    still count, the same as they still resolve. Null when there is no
    episode at all yet.

    The whole episode rather than only its start day, because phase 5
    ticket 27 reads its `drug` too: the anchor decides which literature
    table the effects timeline is allowed to draw, and the drug is the
