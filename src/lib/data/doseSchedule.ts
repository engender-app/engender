   schedule and a range of days, not a row anyone stores. Nothing here
   reads a clock or a database.

   Deliberately no verdict. This file answers "what was expected, and what
   is logged against it", and stops: no target rate, no streak, no
   good/bad. The comparison is the feature (ticket 02, out of scope). */
