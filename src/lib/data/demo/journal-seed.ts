/* Writing the persona into a real journal (ticket 08).

   The demo used to be a `DB` object in localStorage, so "load the demo" was
   an assignment. Entries live in SQLite now, and they cannot live in two
   places at once - leaving the persona in the demo store while the screens
   read the database would mean a review build with an empty app in it. So the
   persona goes through the same journal calls a real user's writes go
   through: every id is minted by the journal (ADR-0002), every photo is a
   real file (ADR-0008), and the FTS index is written by the same code that
   maintains it for real notes (ADR-0005). Search on the demo therefore proves
   something about search.

   Nothing here ships. Like the rest of `demo/`, every import of this module
   sits behind `__DEMO__`, which vite.config.ts folds to `false` in a
   production build (ticket 05).

   Not wrapped in a transaction: the journal's own writes open one each, and
   SQLite has no nested transactions. It is a few thousand statements through
   a worker, which is the price of the persona being real rows rather than a
   fixture, and it runs once per fresh demo install. */

/* A real JPEG rather than a row pointing at a file that is not there.

   The persona used to carry `{ fileName: null }` placeholders, which the

   missing file is precisely the state ADR-0008's write ordering exists to
   prevent. Faking it in the demo would mean the one place a reviewer looks at
   photos is the one place the invariant is broken.

   Drawn rather than bundled, so no image ships, and drawn at both sizes
