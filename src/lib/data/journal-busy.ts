/* Whether the journal is in the middle of something an update must not land
   on (ticket 04).

   A waiting service worker that takes over during a write swaps the code out
   from under a half-finished one. For an entry save that is a spinner that
   never resolves; for a migration or an encryption conversion it can be the
   journal. So the app never asks a waiting worker to activate while anything
   here is open, and never offers the update action either - update.ts reads
   this, and the notice appears when it clears.

   Four things enter: every journal write, which writes.ts wraps at one choke
   point and which covers an Archive import too (an import is a declared write
   on every table); the migrations in boot.ts; and the encryption conversion in
   boot.svelte.ts.

   A counter rather than a flag, because two writes overlap routinely - an
   entry save and the photo store's write land on their own schedules - and the
   first one finishing does not mean the journal is idle. Rune-free like
   writes.ts, for the same two reasons: the Node tier can test it, and a
   service worker's message plumbing has no business in reactive state.

   Two things it deliberately does not cover. Preference writes: one upsert
   into `pref`, which either committed or did not, and a preference is not part
   of the journal (CONTEXT: "Journal") - it is none of the four the ticket
   names. And a second tab, which this counter cannot see: the guard is
   per-page module state, so a tab sitting idle would not know another was
   saving. ADR-0020 is what makes that moot rather than lucky - the encrypted
   driver holds the pool's access handles for one connection per origin, so
   the second tab has no journal open to write to. */

/** Opens the guard, and hands back the release. Call it in a `finally`: a
    write that threw has finished as surely as one that resolved, and a
    release that never runs would keep the app on an old release for the rest

    The release is idempotent, so a caller that has already let go cannot
    release somebody else's write by calling twice. */

/** For housekeeping that must not run alongside a write (phase 5 audit ticket
    02). Both boot passes read rows and then act on what they read, and since
    they moved off boot's critical path they run with the screens live - so a
    write that lands between the read and the act would make the purge delete
    an entry somebody restored, or the sweep delete the files of a photo
    somebody just attached.

    `sawWrite()` answers whether any write has been in flight since the watch
    started, itself included: a pass asks before every step it cannot take
    back, and gives up when the answer is yes. Giving up is safe by
    construction - what a pass does not finish is what the next boot retries,
    which is what both of their failure paths already do.

    Not a lock. Nothing here can stop a write from starting; a screen saving an
    entry has priority over housekeeping by any reading. */
