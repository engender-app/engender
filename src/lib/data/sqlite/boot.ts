/* The boot sequence (ticket 04). Order is load-bearing for later tickets
   and must not change without checking all four:

     1. Read boot-set preferences from localStorage (ticket 06 fills this
        in - theme/palette/language need to apply before first paint, and
        the lock screen needs to render before the database is even open).
     2. Open the database and run migrations (ticket 02) - this ticket's
        own job, fully implemented below.
     3. Load mirrored reference data into reactive state (ticket 08).
     4. Purge trash past its 30-day window, then run the photo orphan sweep
        (ticket 11; phase 5 ticket 19).

   Steps 1, 3 and 4 are dependency-injected no-ops until their tickets land
   - boot() still calls them in order so the shape doesn't change later,
   but nothing here decides what they do. Everything is injected (not
   imported directly) so this file's ordering and error handling can be
   unit-tested in the Node tier against a fake driver, while the real app
   supplies createWebSqlite() from sqlocal-driver.ts. */
