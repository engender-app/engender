/* The worker half of the encrypted web driver (ticket 09, ADR-0020):
   SQLite3MultipleCiphers WASM over the synchronous OPFS SAHPool VFS,
   wrapped in sqlite3mc's encryption shim. The exact open/key/VFS sequence
   is the one the ticket 08 prototype proved out (prototype/encryption/web/
   whole-db-worker.ts on the prototype/encryption-mechanism branch):
   sqlite3mc refuses to encrypt on the async 'opfs' VFS and on a bare
   'opfs-sahpool' - the pool VFS must be wrapped via sqlite3mc_vfs_create()
   and the database opened through the wrapped name.

   A worker because SAHPool's synchronous access handles only exist in one,
   and this file is the only place the wasm module, the pool or a database
   pointer appear - mc-driver.ts talks to it in messages, everything above
   talks to SqliteDriver (ADR-0017).

   Messages are handled strictly in arrival order through one promise
   chain. The handlers after `open` are all synchronous, so this mostly
   guards one case: a statement arriving while the wasm module is still
   initializing must wait for it, not race it.

   The pre-migration copy is VACUUM INTO a URI carrying the same hexkey,
   so the copy is written through a pager keyed like the original's and is
   ciphertext on disk (ADR-0006 + ADR-0018: coverage includes migration
   copies). The wasm build has no sqlite3_backup_*, and the pool util's
   importDb() insists on the plaintext SQLite magic an encrypted file does
   not carry - VACUUM INTO is the copy mechanism that exists here. SAHPool
   stores opaque pool files, so the cleanup goes through the pool util
   rather than OPFS paths.

   The pool's OPFS directory is namespaced per database name (ticket 11):
   SAHPool's directory is shared origin-wide by default, and only one
   worker can hold it at a time - a second encrypted connection open in
   the same origin fails its first sync access handle with "Access
   Handles cannot be created if there is another open Access Handle", a
   failure that then surfaces as a confusing null-database error on
   whatever statement runs next rather than as itself. Production only
   ever opens one connection against the fixed Journal filename, so
   keying the directory off the database name keeps that persistent
   (ADR-0020's web driver survives reloads) while giving anything that
   opens more than one connection at once - namely this codebase's own
   cross-platform archive probe - separate storage instead of a collision. */

  /* Ticket 10: a plaintext-era database becomes the encrypted Journal.

     Not VACUUM INTO, which is how the pre-migration copy below is made.
     sqlite3mc decides a destination's cipher from the source connection's,
     not from the destination URI: with an unencrypted source, VACUUM INTO
     writes an unencrypted file and ignores the `hexkey` in the URI
     entirely. Measured, not assumed - the copy came out carrying "SQLite
     format 3" and the seeded text in the clear. The pre-migration copy is
     unaffected because there the source is already keyed.

     Rekeying the source in memory first is the obvious next idea and
     sqlite3mc refuses it outright: "Rekeying not supported for in-memory
     or temporary databases". So the plaintext goes into the pool under the
     name the Journal will keep, and PRAGMA hexrekey rewrites every page of
     it in place.

     The cost is honest and has to be named: between importDb and the end
     of the rekey there is a readable copy of the Journal in the pool, and
     the rollback journal that makes the rekey atomic holds plaintext pages
     while it runs. Both are inside the window where the app has not
     claimed to be encrypted yet - the source it was copied from is sitting
     in the OPFS root, readable, the whole time - and both are gone before
     the conversion reports success. The claim gate reads the pool's bytes
     afterwards rather than taking that on trust
     (tests/browser-tier/conversion-probe.ts).

     Both names are unlinked first: importDb will not write over a slot
     that is in use, and a target left half-written by a killed attempt is
     thrown away rather than reasoned about, which is what lets the caller
     resume by simply calling this again. */
