/* The Android driver (ticket 11): the same SqliteDriver the web tier
   satisfies, over the local Capacitor plugin in
   android/app/src/main/java/dev/engender/app/sqlite/.

   Why a local plugin rather than @capacitor-community/sqlite is ADR-0020's
   ticket 11 amendment, and it comes down to the key: that plugin takes a
   passphrase and derives the database key itself, where ADR-0018 wants a
   random data key held by the Keystore and handed to SQLCipher raw. So
   `dataKey` here leaves as hex and nothing on either side of the bridge
   stretches it.

   The key is optional and unset for now. Ticket 11 lands the shell, the
   bridge and the driver; ticket 13 lands the Android Keystore that produces
   the key, and the only change it needs here is a caller that passes one.

   Calls are serialized, and the queue below is what does it. The web driver
   gets the same property free, because a worker processes messages in the
   order they were posted; Capacitor dispatches bridge calls on a thread pool
   and guarantees no order at all, so without the queue two statements issued
   back to back could reach SQLite the other way round. Post-order is what the
   migration runner's callback composition assumes, and what makes a BEGIN
   arrive before the statements written after it.

   What the queue does not do - on either platform - is isolate a
   transaction. An unrelated call made while one is open still lands between
   its BEGIN and COMMIT, because both drivers have one connection and one
   queue. Nothing today issues journal work concurrently with a transaction,
   and the web driver has the same exposure, so this is a property the two
   share rather than something Android introduces. */
