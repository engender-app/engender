/* The encrypted web driver (ticket 09): the same WebSqlite bundle
   sqlocal-driver.ts builds, implemented over sqlite3mc in mc-worker.ts
   instead of SQLocal - ADR-0020 replaces the web driver rather than
   reconfiguring it, because SQLocal hard-codes the async OPFS VFS that
   sqlite3mc cannot encrypt on. SQLocal itself stays in the tree for
   ticket 10, which needs to read a plaintext journal during conversion.

   The data key arrives as bytes and leaves this file only as the hex the
   worker feeds to PRAGMA hexkey. Nothing here persists it - that is the
   keystore's job (crypto/keystore.ts), and the whole point of ADR-0018 is
   that no usable key sits beside the ciphertext.

   Construction is synchronous like createWebSqlite's: the worker queues
   the open behind its own message chain, so a failure to initialize or a
   wrong key surfaces on the first statement - which is inside
   runMigrations, exactly where boot() already catches driver failures.

   Transactions are manual BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK for the same reason as in
   sqlocal-driver.ts: the migration runner's callback calls back into the
   driver's own exec, and the worker serializes every statement, so the
   composition holds. */
