/* The web half of ticket 04: a SqliteDriver (driver.ts) and a
   MigrationFileOps (migration-runner.ts), both backed by SQLocal over OPFS
   (PRD's Tech Stack § Data and platform services). The only file allowed
   to mention SQLocal, OPFS or workers - everything downstream talks to
   those two platform-neutral interfaces.

   Both come from one composition root, createWebSqlite(), rather than two
   independent factories, because the pre-migration file copy has to read
   the *same* database OPFS is holding open for the driver - a second
   SQLocal client opened on the same path would fight it for the OPFS sync
   access handle. The backup itself lives at its own path, so it gets its
   own client.

   Transactions are implemented as manual BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK over the
   same `sql` calls exec/query/run use, rather than SQLocal's own tx-scoped
   `transaction()` helper: migration-runner.ts's callback calls back into
   the driver's own exec/setUserVersion (not a separate transaction
   handle), and SQLocal serializes every call through one worker
   connection, so manual BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK composes correctly with that
   - verified directly against a running SQLocal instance. */

    Read-only in intent rather than by a flag: `sql` is here because the

    again on the other side, and because opening the database is what
    applies a rollback journal a killed write left behind. The bytes that
