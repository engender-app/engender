/* The transition roadmap's tracks and its country packs (phase 4 ticket
   23, CONTEXT: "Roadmap goal", "Country pack", "Roadmap track").

   A country pack is bundled content, not reference data (CONTEXT:
   "Reference data"): nothing about it is per-install, so there is no row
   to seed and no table to migrate when a pack gains an item. It is
   compiled into the bundle and read synchronously, which is also the whole
   of what "fully offline" means here - a pack is inert data, so a screen
   showing one cannot reach for the network. Only the ticks are stored, and
   journal/roadmap.ts owns those.

   Keys only, no text, the same rule builtins.ts follows and for the same
   reason (ADR-0002): wording lives in vocabulary/roadmapLabels.ts and
   changes with the language, and this file stays Node-tier safe by
   importing no paraglide (ADR-0016).

   The four tracks are the app's structure and a pack populates them; a
   goal belongs to exactly one. Nothing here models one goal blocking
   another, because the ticket's whole point is that each is independently
   checkable - a person part-way through a court case may well have done
   the presentational things first, or none of them. Order within a track
   is the order the procedure usually runs in, and it is a suggestion the
   screen renders rather than a rule anything enforces. */
