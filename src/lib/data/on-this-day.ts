/* Which past days on-this-day checks today (phase 4 features ticket 03).

   Three lookback points - a month, six months and a year ago - each a
   calendar-arithmetic answer over `todayEpochDay`, kept here rather than in
   a screen for the same reason wrapped.ts is: the awkward edges are
   calendar rules, not something that needs a browser to work out.

   Whether a candidate day is worth resurfacing - CONTEXT.md's "good day" -
   is a journal read (mood, tags), not calendar arithmetic, so it lives on
   StatsArea.isGoodDay instead of here. This file only says which epoch days
   to ask about; each is checked against that rule independently, and
   nothing here decides which (if any) qualify. */
