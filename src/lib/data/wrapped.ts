/* Which period a wrapped covers, and which one Home offers today (phase 4
   features ticket 01).

   A wrapped is a retrospective on a *completed* week, month or year
   (CONTEXT: Wrapped). Nothing here reads the clock and nothing here reads
   the journal: today arrives as an argument, the answer is a pair of epoch
   days, and the numbers inside that range come from the recap seam
   (journal/stats.ts) at the moment a screen asks for them. That is what
   keeps a wrapped from drifting out of step with later edits to the entries
   it summarizes - there is no stored wrapped to drift.

   Kept beside epochDay.ts rather than in a screen because both rules below
   are calendar arithmetic with awkward edges - the previous week across a
   year boundary, three cadences colliding on 1 January - and a rule that
   needs a browser to ask is a rule nobody checks. */

    One number for all three cadences, deliberately: a floor picked per
    cadence would be three judgements to keep in step, and the thing being
    judged is the same either way - whether there is enough in the period to
    fill a screen rather than a screen of empty sections. Five is the point
    where the arcs, the tags and the counts all have something to say; below
    it a wrapped is a list of ones and zeroes. */

    Not one number, because "just ended" is relative to how long the period
    was: a week-old weekly wrapped is stale and a week-old yearly one is
    still news. The week's window can never expire - the previous
    Monday-to-Sunday week always ended one to seven days ago - so it is the

    Ranked by cadence rather than by which period ended most recently, and

    ended yesterday and January ended a fortnight ago, and January is the
    better offer - it is the bigger retrospective, and it is still new
    enough to be worth reading. Ranking by end date instead would put the
    weekly card on Home nearly every day and leave the yearly one a
    three-day appearance in January.
