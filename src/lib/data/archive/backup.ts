/* Every way a copy of the journal can leave the device (ticket 15, PRD
   F21), and the timestamp that says one did. How old that timestamp is
   allowed to get is backupHealth.ts.

   The paths are a list rather than three call sites, because the promise
   F21 makes is about all of them at once - Home tells someone their
   journal is safe on the strength of `lastBackupAt`, so a path that
   forgets to stamp it is a screen that lies. Adding a path means adding it
   to EXPORT_PATHS, which is what backup.test.ts enumerates: a new one is
   under the timestamp test the moment it exists, and one that isn't in the
   list isn't wired to the screen either.

   Android's scheduled auto-export joins this list when the shell lands.
   It is the same shape - produce a file, hand it off, stamp the time -
   with a Keystore-wrapped key and a SAF folder in place of the share
   sheet.

   Nothing here writes a preference. The recorder is passed in: this module
   is under Node-tier tests and the preference store is a Svelte $state
   projection, and the seam is honest anyway - what a delivered export
   means for the journal's settings is the screen's business. */
