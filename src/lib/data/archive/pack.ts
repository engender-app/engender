/* Packing and unpacking an archive: the payload and the photo files on one
   side, the framed container (container.ts) on the other.

   The body is the payload as JSON behind its own length, then every photo
   file it names, back to back, in manifest order. Nothing is base64'd -
   the whole point of a binary container is that a photo can travel as
   bytes rather than as a third more bytes of text - and nothing describes
   a file twice: the manifest inside the JSON says how long each one is,
   which is also what settles the chunk count before the first chunk is
   encrypted (ADR-0007).

   Both directions are streams. Packing holds one photo and one chunk;
   unpacking hands photos over one at a time as the body reaches them, so
   ticket 14 can write each file as it arrives instead of holding a
   restored journal's worth of images in memory. */
