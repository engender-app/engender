/* What an archive carries, and how an older one is brought forward.

   These interfaces are the wire format, which is why they are written out
   here rather than aliased to the domain types in data/types.ts that some
   of them currently match. The domain types belong to the app and change
   with it; this shape belongs to every archive ever written, and a change
   to it is a format version and a migration, not an edit. Keeping them
   separate means a rename in the app cannot silently change what a backup
   file looks like.

   Identity is the travelling kind throughout (ADR-0002): the seeded key
   for a built-in row, the minted uuid for a user's own, which is what lets
   ticket 14 match an archive's rows against a device's without sharing a
   rowid space. Entries carry their uuid rather than the rowid the app
   addresses them by locally.

   Photo bytes are not in here. The payload names the files it travels
   with; the files themselves follow it in the archive body (pack.ts), so
   neither packing nor unpacking has to hold more than one photo at a time. */

   importing this archive cannot re-derive it - the dose log the figure was

   never have existed on that device. Leaving it behind would lose it.

   ticket 03 will not have them however the type is spelled. No format
