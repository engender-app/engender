/* The plain export (ticket 15, PRD F22): the journal as CSV or JSON, with
   no encryption anywhere near it. The screen puts it behind a warning and a
   confirm; this file only knows how to write the two files.

   It reads the same snapshot the encrypted archive is packed from, so
   there is one description of what a journal holds rather than two that
   drift. What it does not reuse is the archive's identity: uuids and file
   names mean nothing in a spreadsheet, and there is no plain import path
   to match rows for (F22). The CSV is what a person reads, so it carries
   words - dimension names, tag labels, values in native units (ADR-0012).

   Built-in rows are stored as bare keys with no wording at all
   (builtins.ts), so the names have to come from the message catalogue.
   They arrive as functions rather than as an import: labels.ts is
   paraglide, and nothing the Node tier touches may import it (ADR-0016). */

    with all three in it sooner or later, which is the one thing a
    hand-rolled CSV always gets wrong. Rows are separated by a bare LF
    rather than the RFC's CRLF - every spreadsheet reads both, and a note's
    own newlines are LF, so one file with two conventions in it would be
    stranger than one that consistently uses the shorter.

    A field starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` is a formula to Excel and
    LibreOffice, not text - and a note is a person's own words, sometimes
    handed to a clinician, so a leading one gets a `'` in front of it. That
    guard is a spreadsheet convention, not an RFC 4180 quote, so it runs
