/* Choosing an archive to import (ticket 14, PRD F14).

   The web half, like photos/picker.ts is for photos: on Android this becomes
   the shell's own file picker, and the screen above must never learn which
   one it got.

   Bytes rather than a File, and a stream rather than one buffer: opening an
   archive reads the header, then the payload, then the photo files as the
   body reaches them (pack.ts), so restoring years of photos never holds more
   than a chunk of it.

   `bytes()` is a function and not a value, because a wrong password is a
   retry rather than a dead end: every attempt gets its own read of the same
   file, and a stream cannot be consumed twice. */
