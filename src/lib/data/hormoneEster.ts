/* Which injectable estradiol ester a regimen episode is, for the hormone
   curve (phase 4 ticket 10). Pure, above the journal seam and free of
   paraglide (ADR-0016), like regimenEpisode.ts next to it; the wording for
   these keys lives in vocabulary/hormoneCurveLabels.ts.

   A closed vocabulary read out of two free-text fields, which is the awkward
   part. `RegimenEpisode.drug` and `.ester` are as free as an analyte's unit
   or a lab provider (CONTEXT: "Regimen episode") - there is no ester enum in
   the schema and this ticket does not add one, because a curve is a reading
   of the regimen rather than a new thing to record. So the resolution here
   is the same shape as ADR-0026's analyte allowlist: match the typed text
   against a built-in list of names, and answer null for anything the list
   does not know rather than guessing. An unrecognized ester gets no curve.

   Both catalogues' languages are matched, because these two fields hold
   whatever the user typed and the Polish names are not the English ones with
   an accent on them - "walerianian estradiolu" shares no ester word with
   "estradiol valerate". */

/** The esters this app draws. Four, and every one of them has a published
    fit tight enough to be worth drawing (hormoneCurveModels.ts).

    Polyestradiol phosphate and estradiol undecylate are deliberately not
    here. PEP has no parameters this repository can use at all. Undecylate has
    some, but they rest on a handful of injections followed for about a
    fortnight against an ester that acts for months, so the fit constrained
    almost nothing - its plausible average level spanned more than tenfold
    where these four span about a third. A curve that loose is not worth
    drawing even with a label on it, so neither ester resolves and neither
    gets a curve. Order is the order screens list them in. */
