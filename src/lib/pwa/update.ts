/* When a new release is allowed to take over (ticket 04, and the decision
   ADR-0021 deliberately left to it).

   The worker installs a new release quietly and then waits. Left alone the
   browser would activate it whenever the last page using the old one goes
   away, which is safe but can be weeks for an installed app that is never
   fully closed. So the app asks - and the rule for when it may ask is the
   whole point of this module:

     - never while the journal is busy. A write, a migration, an encryption
       conversion or an Archive import in flight means the code must not be
       swapped, so nothing is offered and nothing is sent
       (journal-busy.ts).
     - only when a person acts. There is no timer and no automatic apply: a
       reload the person did not ask for is an interruption whatever the
       journal is doing.

   That is also why the notice can appear on its own but never disappear into
   an update: going idle is allowed to offer, and only a tap applies.

   Rune-free, so the browser tier can drive it without the Svelte plugin
   (tests/browser-tier/update-probe.ts) and the Node tier can drive its
   decisions against a fake registration. UpdateNotice.svelte is the reactive
   half, over onUpdateReadyChange. */

    build back. The commonest cause is a service worker that is still serving
    the old release, which is precisely what this fixes; when the origin itself
    has been rolled back there is nothing newer to find, and false says so.

    a quick log saved in the same moment as the tap is enough for that, and
    the save is the thing that must not be interrupted.

    Waiting for `controllerchange` before reloading is what makes the reload
    land on the new release: reload first and the old worker is still in
    charge, so the page comes back on the old release and the notice with it.

    It is waited for with a limit, though, because it is not this page's to
    guarantee - an install that goes redundant, or a worker that never gets to
    activate, would otherwise leave the button disabled for the rest of the
    session with nothing on screen to say why. Reloading anyway is the better
    end: either the new release is in charge, or the notice is back. */
