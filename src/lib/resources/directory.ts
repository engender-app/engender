/* The bundled resource directory (ticket 32): trans organisations, helplines
   and reading, in the app rather than fetched from anywhere. Something a
   person reaches for at three in the morning with no signal has to be there
   with no signal, and this is the only screen in the app whose whole content
   is other people's phone numbers and addresses.

   Trans-specific only. No 112, no 999, no general crisis line: a person in
   Poland already knows those numbers, and a directory that opens with them
   buries the three entries they came here for.

   Keys and language-neutral facts only. A name like "Fundacja Trans-Fuzja" is
   a proper noun and reads the same in both catalogues, and a number is a
   number, so those live here; what an entry offers and when it answers does
   not survive translation, so labels.ts holds it (the same split as
   vocabulary/builtins.ts, ADR-0016). This file takes nothing but types, so
   the Node tier can check it without dragging in paraglide.

   `as const`, so the key list also produces the union labels.ts has to cover
   exhaustively: an entry added here without its wording is a typecheck
   failure rather than a raw key in front of someone who needs the number.

   RESOURCES_REVIEWED_ON is a claim, not a build stamp. It says a person
   opened every site below and read the number and the hours off what the
   organisation itself publishes. Hours are what rots: Mindline Trans+ went
   from three evenings a week to one and Trans Lifeline stopped being a
   24-hour line, both while their numbers stayed put. Do not bump the date
   without doing the pass. */
