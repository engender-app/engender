  /* The quiet update action (ticket 04).

     A notice rather than a modal or a toast, and the reasons are in the
     acceptance wording. It does not interrupt: a toast would expire before
     someone mid-entry looked up, and a modal would take the screen away from
     whatever they were doing. It does not nag: dismissing it ends it for this
     load of the app, and nothing brings it back until the next one.

     It appears only when the journal is idle, which update.ts decides - so a
     save, a migration, an Archive import or an encryption conversion in
     flight is a notice that is not on screen yet rather than one that has to
     be argued with. */
