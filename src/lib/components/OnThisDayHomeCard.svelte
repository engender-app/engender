  /* Home's link into on-this-day (phase 4 features ticket 03).

     One card for however many of the three lookbacks qualify today - the
     ticket does not ask for exactly one, and ranking them the way wrapped
     ranks cadences would invent an ordering rule this feature has no use
     for. The good-day check for each lookback is the only thing this card
     needs to know before deciding whether to show itself at all.

     Rendered only when on-this-day is on: Home gates on the preference
     before mounting this, so the query below does not exist while the
     feature is off - the same split wrapped's own card makes.

     Home's second look-back tile since phase 5 ticket 21. It used to be a
     full-width card carrying the same gradient wash as wrapped's, on
     purpose, so the two read as siblings; the tiles say that by sitting in
     one grid instead, which is a thing the eye reads without a wash. */
