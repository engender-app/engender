  /* What entry lists, stats, search and recap show while the worker answers
     (ADR-0004). Deliberately not a spinner: the mockup's language is soft
     surfaces that stagger in (DESIGN.md item 10), and a placeholder shaped
     like the thing it is waiting for keeps the page from jumping when the
     real content lands.

     `variant` picks a shape, not a screen, so the same three cover every
     waiting surface in the app. Anything longer than one round trip on OPFS
     is unusual, so these are rarely on screen for long - which is also why
     they carry no text of their own to translate. */
