/* Reports real derivation time for both Argon2id parameter sets (ticket
   12's acceptance), so ARCHIVE_ARGON2_PARAMS/PIN_ENCRYPTION_ARGON2_PARAMS in
   src/lib/crypto/params.ts can be re-tuned against real hardware rather
   than guessed - ADR-0013 explicitly defers the exact numbers to this.
   Run with `npm run benchmark:argon2`.

   Timed on whatever machine runs this script, not the "mid-range 2020
