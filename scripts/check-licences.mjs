/* The licence of everything the lockfile installs, checked on every pull
   request (phase 2 ticket 06).

   Gender Diary is GPL-3.0-only, and one channel decides for itself whether it
   agrees: F-Droid rebuilds from source and rejects a dependency graph it
   cannot build freely (ticket 18). A dependency that arrives under a licence
   nobody looked at is how that turns into a rejected build months later, when
   the dependency has become load-bearing.

   The allowed list is what this tree actually uses rather than every licence
   that would be acceptable. A new one is then a decision someone makes, with
   the dependency in front of them, instead of passing because the list was
   written wide enough.

   Run `node scripts/check-licences.mjs` to see the tree's licences. */

/** Licences in the tree today, all of them GPL-3.0 compatible.

    BlueOak-1.0.0 and Unlicense arrived with Capacitor in phase 2 ticket 11
    and were decided then. Both are permissive, neither is copyleft, and
    neither restricts redistribution or carries field-of-use terms, so
    ticket 18's F-Droid rebuild is unaffected by either.

    - BlueOak-1.0.0 is OSI-approved and permissive, adding an explicit patent
      grant over what MIT says. It came in under @capacitor/cli, through the
      npm-maintained tooling packages: glob, minimatch, lru-cache, minipass,
      path-scurry, rimraf, tar, chownr, yallist, package-json-from-dist.
    - Unlicense is a public-domain dedication the FSF lists as GPL
      compatible. Same subtree: big-integer and stream-buffers. */

/** Packages with no `license` field, and where the licence was read from

    - the package ships a licence file and only omits the field, so the
      tarball itself says what it is; and
    - the package ships no licence text at all, so the answer comes from the
      source repository its own `repository.url` points at. Weaker, because
      a tarball is what actually gets redistributed - recorded here with the
      repository read, so whoever revisits it knows what was checked.
