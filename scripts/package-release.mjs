/* What a signed tag turns into (phase 2 ticket 06): a web bundle, a source
   archive, checksums over both, and the proof that the bundle can be rebuilt
   from the same tag byte for byte.

   The version comes from scripts/app-version.mjs, which reads the signed tag,
   and this script refuses to package anything else. A development version in
   a release artifact is the failure ADR-0022 exists to prevent, and it is
   cheaper to refuse here than to unpublish a release later.

   Reproducibility is checked rather than claimed: the build runs twice and the
   two bundles have to have the same digest. A checksum over a bundle nobody
   can rebuild says only that the download was not corrupted, which is the
   smaller half of what a checksum is for. Two builds also cost two minutes,
   and a release happens rarely.

   Everything in the output directory is checksummed, including files this
   script did not write. That is how ticket 18's signed Android artifacts join
   a release: put them in the directory before this runs.

   Run `node scripts/package-release.mjs`. On a checkout with no signed tag,
   ENGENDER_VERSION=<version> is the deliberate way in (ADR-0022) and a dry
   run of the whole path. */
