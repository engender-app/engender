/**
 * The bridge to Android Keystore and the biometric prompt, as five calls
 * that {@code src/lib/lock/android-key.ts} reads.
 *
 * <p>Every answer is an outcome string from {@link BiometricOutcomes}, and a
 * data key rides along only with {@code authenticated}. Nothing here decides
 * whether the Journal opens - the Keystore decided that by unwrapping or by
 * refusing to - so a bug in this file cannot produce a key it was not given.
 * What it can do is describe a refusal wrongly, which is why the states are
 * kept apart rather than collapsed into "it didn't work".
 *
 * <p>The prompt does not quietly fall through to the device credential when
 * there is no usable biometric. The ticket is explicit that unavailable and
 * unenrolled must not result in an unlocked Journal, so those come back as
 * themselves and the screen offers the credential as something the person
 * chooses - {@code deviceCredential} on the next call - rather than as a
 * slide the app made on their behalf.
