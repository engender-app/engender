/**
 * One SQLCipher database and the type mapping between it and the bridge.
 *
 * <p>Two deliberate omissions. There is no write-ahead log: AOSP's
 * SQLiteDatabase, which sqlcipher-android forks, keeps a connection pool of
 * one while WAL is off and grows it when WAL is on, and a pool would put a
 * {@code BEGIN} on one connection and the statements it is meant to wrap on
 * another. The web driver gets the same property from its worker serializing
 * everything onto one connection, and the migration runner's callback
 * composition depends on it in both places.
 *
 * <p>And there is no key derivation. A hex key arrives already stretched or
 * already random (ADR-0013, ADR-0018) and is handed to SQLCipher in its raw
 * key form, which is the whole reason this bridge exists instead of
 * {@code @capacitor-community/sqlite} (ADR-0020, ticket 11 amendment).
