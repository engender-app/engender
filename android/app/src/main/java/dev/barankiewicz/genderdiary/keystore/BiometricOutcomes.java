/**
 * Android's two biometric vocabularies, folded into the one the app reads
 * (src/lib/lock/biometric-outcome.ts is the other end of it).
 *
 * <p>There are two because Android asks the question twice. {@link
 * BiometricManager#canAuthenticate(int)} answers before a prompt is shown -
 * is there hardware, is anything enrolled on it - and {@code
 * BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback} answers after, with a different
 * numbering that overlaps the first only by accident. Fifteen error codes
 * arrive between them and the app reacts to seven states, so the mapping has
 * to be written down somewhere; here, where it is a pure function of an int
 * and can be tested without a device.
 *
 * <p>The direction of every default is refusal. An error code nobody mapped
 * becomes {@link #FAILED}, never a success, because the failure mode the
 * ticket warns about is a platform growing a code and a truthy check letting
 * it through.
