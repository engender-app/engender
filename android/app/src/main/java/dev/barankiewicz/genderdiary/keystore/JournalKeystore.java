/**
 * Where the Journal's data key lives on Android (ticket 13, ADR-0018).
 *
 * <p>The key itself is 32 random bytes, the same key the web mints and wraps
 * under a passphrase. Here it is wrapped by a key pair that Android Keystore
 * generated and will not hand out: the private half never leaves the
 * platform's keystore, and it is bound to the device's lock screen, so it
 * cannot be used until Android says somebody authenticated. A copy of the
 * app's files therefore yields the wrapped blob and nothing that opens it,
 * which is the claim ADR-0018 makes and {@code AndroidEncryptionClaimTest}
 * proves by reading the bytes.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a key pair rather than AES.</b> A user-authentication-bound
 * symmetric key requires authentication for encryption as well as
 * decryption, which would mean a biometric prompt on a first run - before
 * there is a Journal, to protect nothing - and would leave the wrap itself
 * untestable without a person's finger. With RSA the public half wraps
 * freely and only the private half asks. First run is silent; every later
 * boot asks; and the instrumentation test can create a real key on a real
 * device and then prove that unwrapping it without authenticating fails.
 *
 * <p><b>Two ways to be authorized</b>, because the platform changed. From
 * API 30 the key is per-use authorized and the prompt carries the very
 * {@link Cipher} it authorizes, so nothing but that operation is unlocked.
 * Below 30, {@code CryptoObject} cannot be combined with the device
 * credential at all, so the key is authorized for a few seconds after a
 * successful prompt instead and the unwrap happens inside that window. The
 * weaker of the two is the one the platform offers there.
 *
 * <p><b>The cliff, stated once.</b> A Keystore key bound to the lock screen
 * is destroyed by the platform when that lock screen is removed. The wrapped
 * blob outlives the key that opens it, so this file has nothing left to give:
 * that is the Android shape of ADR-0018's "forgotten credentials have no
 * data-preserving recovery", it is reported as its own state rather than as a
 * failed finger (BiometricOutcomes.KEY_INVALIDATED), and the copy that tells
 * people to keep a screen lock and export Archives is the mitigation.
 *
 * <p>Since ADR-0054 the journal itself can survive that, which is a claim
 * about a different file rather than about this one. A recovery key seals the
 * same 32 bytes under 120 bits somebody wrote down, in recovery-key.json,
 * which no Keystore alias is involved in - so a destroyed alias is no longer
 * the end of the journal for anyone who made one. Nothing here changes: this
 * class still holds a blob it cannot open, and it is not what opens it. The
 * entry path that offers the written key is AndroidKeyGate's, on the
 * invalidated screen this paragraph describes: where a recovery key exists
 * that screen leads with it rather than offering a reset and nothing else.
