/**
 * The Keystore half of ticket 13, on a device, because none of it is true
 * anywhere else. Whether a key is really in Android Keystore, whether it is
 * really bound to the lock screen, and what the platform does when that lock
 * screen is removed are properties of the platform rather than of this code.
 *
 * <p>Most cases only need a lock screen to already exist, so {@link
 * #ensureLockScreen()} sets one through the shell only when none is there -
 * on a real phone that is never, so its own credential is left untouched.
 * Only the two cases that need to see the screen come off entirely -
 * creating with none, and losing the key when one that existed is removed -
 * clear it, and they run only on an emulator ({@link #isEmulator()}): a
 * throwaway lock screen can be put back the way this class found it
 * afterwards, a phone's daily-driver credential cannot, so those two are
 * skipped rather than failed anywhere else.
 *
 * <p>What this deliberately does not do is authenticate. An emulator cannot
 * be made to present a finger, so the unwrap is asserted from the other
 * direction, which is the direction that matters: without authentication the
 * platform refuses, and the wrapped blob on disk yields nothing. Every
 * biometric state is covered exhaustively over the error codes themselves in
 * {@code BiometricOutcomesTest}, a JVM test, and the reasoning for that split
 * is written there.
