/* Builds an android-tier probe into a static bundle the instrumentation
   tests serve to the app's WebView (ticket 11, ticket 13).

   Separate from the app's vite.config.ts and named so svelte-check's project
   auto-discovery does not pick it up, for the same reason the browser tier's
   config is - run.mjs loads it explicitly.

   A build rather than a dev server: a probe runs inside an emulator's
   WebView from the app's own file system, where there is no host to reach.
   Relative asset paths for the same reason, since Bridge.setServerBasePath
   serves a bundle from a directory rather than from a document root - which
   is also why each probe is its own self-contained bundle in its own
   directory rather than two pages sharing one.

   They build straight into the test APK's assets rather than into a dist/
   beside this file. Partly to save a copy step, but mostly because
   SvelteKit's generated tsconfig includes every .js file under tests/, so a
   bundle left there becomes 400 svelte-check errors in generated code.

   ANDROID_TIER_PROBE picks which one; run.mjs builds both. */
