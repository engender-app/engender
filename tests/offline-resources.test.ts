/* Ticket 32's second acceptance criterion, and the only one a person cannot
   check by looking at the screen: opening the resource directory, and
   interacting inside it, makes no network request of any kind.

   The whole app already holds that line - `connect-src 'self'` in
   deploy/nginx/journal-headers.conf, and the About sheet says so in
   m.about_no_network_title(). What is new here is a screen whose content is
   phone numbers and web addresses, which is exactly the shape that invites
   someone to make it fetch a live copy, embed an org's logo, or check whether
   a line is still up. This test is what stops that arriving unnoticed.

   It reads sources rather than driving a browser because the Node tier has no
   browser (vitest.config.ts). A source grep is a weak test in general -
   tests/android-back-navigation-wiring.test.ts says as much - but the thing
   being guarded is literally the absence of a call, and absence is what a
   grep is good at. The browser tier's offline relaunch
   (tests/browser-tier/verify-build.mjs) is the belt to this pair of braces.

   The links the screen renders are not requests: a `tel:` or `https:` anchor
   sends nothing until a person taps it, and a tap hands the address to the
   dialler or the system browser rather than fetching anything in the app. */
