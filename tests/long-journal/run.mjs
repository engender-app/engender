/* The ten-year benchmark (phase 2 ticket 20). Run with
   `npm run benchmark:long-journal`.

   Its own script rather than another block in tests/browser-tier/run.mjs,
   and its own CI job. The run takes 44 seconds, most of it writing the
   fixture, and it leaves 340MB in the origin's storage - so folding it into
   the browser tier would put that alongside every other probe's SAHPool for
   the rest of that run, and add 44 seconds to a suite that answers a
   different kind of question. This one gates on timing rather than on
   correctness, so a wobble here should not turn the correctness suite red,
   and its log should be retrievable on its own. As a separate CI job it
   also runs concurrently, which costs nothing in wall clock.

   Two modes. By default it measures and fails on anything over budget,
   which is what CI wants. With --record it prints the numbers in the shape
   budgets.json wants and fails on nothing, which is what re-baselining on
   new hardware wants. */
