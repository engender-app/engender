/* The regression budget (phase 2 ticket 20), and the rule for reading it.

   Three numbers per measurement, each with a different job:

     baselineMs           what the ten-year run actually measured, on the
                          machine and browser named in budgets.json.
     budgetMs             what CI fails on: five times the baseline, with a
                          200ms floor. Set that far above the baseline
                          because the baseline came off a quiet desktop and
                          the gate runs on a shared ubuntu-latest runner,
                          which is the slower machine by an unknown factor.
                          A gate that trips on that difference gets disabled
                          within a week. This one is here to catch a
                          pagination-shaped regression - work that grew with
                          the journal, which arrives as a multiple rather
                          than a percentage - not noise. If CI turns out to
                          be quieter than feared, re-record from a CI run
                          and tighten it; widening it further is not the
                          answer.
     targetMs             what a person waiting for that screen can stand.
                          Nothing to do with the baseline. A measurement
                          whose baseline is over its target is a release
                          problem and gets its own ticket with the
                          measurement attached; optimization is not this
                          ticket's job. The two housekeeping passes get a
                          loose one on purpose: nothing on screen waits for
                          them since phase 5 audit ticket 02, so what their
                          target asks is whether the pass is still small
                          enough to run in one go on an idle machine.

  Memory is intentionally not watched here.

  The desktop probe can be launched with flags that expose gc() and
  performance.memory, but Android WebView does not expose those in this
  harness. That leaves one platform sampling and one not, and the sampled
  deltas swing with collector timing enough to be noisy (the same fixture
  produced 58.4MB and then 7.5MB for Archive export). A noisy gate gets
  switched off, and a one-platform gate gives false confidence.

  If this suite starts watching memory again, it needs one stable
  measurement API that works in both harnesses without launch-only flags,
  then a rerun on device to set real baselines.

   A measurement with no entry here is a breach rather than a pass. The
   alternative fails open: adding a measurement to measure.ts and
   forgetting the budget would leave CI quietly not watching it. */

/** How much room a mount's byte budget leaves over the bytes it recorded.

    The two count budgets are ratchets rather than gates, so the rule is
    tighter than the time rule by design: `budgetMs` absorbs a shared CI
    runner being slower than a quiet desktop by an unknown factor, and a
    statement count has no such wobble to absorb. The fixture is generated
    from a fixed seed, so a mount fires the same statements over the same
    rows on every machine - and a statement budget is therefore exactly what
    was recorded. One extra statement is a screen asking a new question, and
    that is the thing worth failing on.

    Bytes get a tenth of headroom for one case only: a column renamed or an
    id scheme changed moves the serialised length a little without any
    screen asking for more. A read that widened - a list where a scalar
    would do - moves it by a multiple, which this still catches. */
