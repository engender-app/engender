/* A deterministic ten-year Journal (phase 2 ticket 20).

   Everything in the app has been demoed against a Journal a few weeks old.
   This writes the one the product actually asks people to keep: a decade of
   entries, photos, lab results and milestones, through the same
   `openJournal(driver, files)` handle a person's own writes go through
   (ADR-0017). Nothing here reaches for a driver, a file store or a
   platform, so the Android driver that ticket 11 is building drops in
   underneath without this file changing.

   Deterministic in the only sense a benchmark needs: the same seed writes
   the same content, so two runs measure the code rather than the fixture.
   Identity is the exception - the journal mints a uuid per row (ADR-0002)
   and a seed cannot reach into that. No clock is read either, here or
   below: `timestamp` comes from the day and the entry's place in it, and
   the last day of the journal is a constant rather than today, so the
   fixture does not drift as the calendar does.

   Photo bytes arrive from the caller. A representative photo is a real
   JPEG at the sizes ADR-0008 normalizes to, which needs a canvas the Node
   tier has not got, and the byte size is most of what the photo grid and
   the Archive export are measuring - so the platform that has the canvas
   supplies it. */
