/* The harness's own tests (phase 2 ticket 20). Node tier, over node:sqlite

   check is that the harness measures what it says it measures and that
   budgets.json covers exactly what it produces. The numbers themselves are
   the browser tier's job, where the driver is encrypted and the storage is
   real.

   The budget file being complete is worth a test rather than a review: a
