/* Ticket 04's schema half, on the real platform: sqlite3mc over the OPFS
   SAHPool, the real migration runner, and the pre-migration copy as an
   actual file in the pool rather than a spy counting calls.

   The Node tier proves the runner's decisions against node:sqlite
   (migration-runner.test.ts). Three of this ticket's acceptance boxes are
   claims about files, and a fake file-ops object cannot be asked to keep one:

     - newer code migrates an older Journal forward and the data survives;
     - older code refuses a Journal a newer schema already touched, and leaves
       it exactly as it was;
     - a migration that fails leaves a copy that verifies, a retry does not
       spend it, and putting it back gets the previous visible Journal.

   "Newer code" and "older code" are migration arrays here rather than two
   builds: the runner takes the list it is given, so a list with one more step
   in it is precisely what a later release is, as far as a database is
   concerned. The extra steps are this probe's own - a column nothing reads,
   and one deliberately broken statement - so the real migrations stay the
   only thing that ever runs against a real Journal.

   Every driver is closed before the next opens: the pool's synchronous access
   handles belong to one worker at a time (ADR-0020). */
