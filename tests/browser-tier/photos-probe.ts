/* Browser-tier check for ticket 11. Two things can only be proved here:

   normalize() needs a real decoder and a real canvas, and the claims it
   makes are about bytes a canvas produced - that no EXIF survives
   (ADR-0015), that the rotation the EXIF described survived instead, and
   that a big photo comes back at 2048px. A Node-tier test could only
   assert against a stub encoder, which would prove nothing about the one
   that actually runs.

   The OPFS file store is the other: write/read/list/remove against real
   OPFS, plus the one that matters for safety - that it works in a
   subdirectory of its own, so the orphan sweep can never see the database
   file SQLocal keeps in the OPFS root. */
