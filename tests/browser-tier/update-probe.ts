/* Ticket 04's update rule, against a real browser's service-worker
   lifecycle.

   The Node tier drives the decision against a fake registration
   (src/lib/pwa/update.test.ts). What only a browser can answer is whether
   the decision holds when the lifecycle is real: whether a second release
   genuinely installs and waits behind the first, whether a waiting worker
   left unasked really does stay put through an attempt to apply it, and
   whether asking it - once the journal is idle - actually ends with the new
   worker in control of this page.

   Two things here are the tier's rather than the app's. The worker is
   /update-sw.js, served with a generation number the dev server changes on
   demand (browser-tier.vite.config.ts), because the app's own worker only
   exists after a build; it imports the skip-waiting listener from the app's
   source, so the message being honoured is the shipped one. And `reload` is
   recorded instead of performed, since a probe that reloaded would throw its
   own results away - everything below it, skipWaiting and controllerchange
   included, is the browser doing the real thing. */
