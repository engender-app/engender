/* Release gate (ticket 04's acceptance: "verify it, do not assume it"):
   confirms the production build (`npm run build`) is a static SPA that
   makes zero requests off its own origin - the SQLocal .wasm/worker in
   particular, which Rive's canvas package already gets wrong by
   defaulting to a CDN. Serves build/ with `vite preview` and drives a
   real Chromium through it with Playwright.

   It also reads the emitted JavaScript from disk (ticket 05): the Alice
   persona and the demo bar have to be absent from a production build, and
   the only way to know is to look at what was written, not at the source
   that was supposed to guard them. Run with `npm run verify:build` after
   `npm run build`.

   The second half installs the app for real (phase 2 ticket 03): manifest,
   service worker and precached shell, then kills the network and starts the
   app again. That is the check no test against a dev server can make -
   neither the worker nor the manifest exists until something is built. */
