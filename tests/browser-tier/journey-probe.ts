/* Browser-tier check for ticket 27's photo journey export.

   Three things can only be proved here. The collage and the timelapse are
   bytes a canvas produced, so a Node-tier test could only assert against a
   stub encoder. MediaRecorder does not exist in Node at all. And the claim
   the ticket actually makes - that generating an export transmits nothing,
   and only the share step does - is a claim about navigator.share, which
   means watching a real one.

   The source photos are three flat colours in journey order, which is what
   makes the composition checkable: a collage that drew them out of order,
   or drew the surround where a photo should be, comes back with the wrong
   pixel in the wrong cell. */
