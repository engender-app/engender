/* The licence check CI runs (phase 2 ticket 06). enGender is GPL-3.0-only
   and one channel - F-Droid, ticket 18 - rebuilds from source and rejects a
   dependency graph it cannot build freely. A dependency arriving under a
   licence nobody looked at is the way that turns into a rejected build long
   after the dependency became load-bearing.

   The allowed list is what the tree actually uses rather than every licence
   that would be acceptable, so a new one surfaces as a decision instead of
   passing on a technicality. */
